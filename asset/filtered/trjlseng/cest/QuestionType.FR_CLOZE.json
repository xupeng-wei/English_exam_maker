Time is something that we can’t see or touch, but we can feel it passing by. Time is always with us. When we are at table, time passes; when we play, time goes by unnoticeable. We always say “<blank text=47>”, but time is even more precious（珍贵的）than money, because when money is spent, we can earn it back. But if time is gone away, it will never return. So, some of us even say time is priceless（无价的）.\nWe should always remember : Future is now. For us students, we should try our best to work hard in order to create a great future of our own. We should make the best use if every hour and be the master（主人）of today. We should do everything before us as well as possible. And “<blank text=48>”\nAs we all know, “ <blank text=49> ” If you waste today, you will regret（后悔）tomorrow. So from now on, work hard. Tomorrow will be better, and your future will be brighter.

            "context": "Rock climbing is a popular hobby that many people enjoy doing. You can do it indoors on special walls or outdoors on real mountains. There are many advantages of rock climbing—it is fun and it also helps people forget worries.\nThe most important equipment(装备)to have is good shoes. They need to be half a size smaller than your usual size. The next thing you need is a harness(保护带).This allows you to move freely, but will hold you up if you fall. It's important to know how to use your equipment. Otherwise, it may be dangerous. If you are a beginner, it's best to have lessons. A climber with experience can help you a lot in the beginning.\nRock climbing is very exciting for people of different ages. Climbers, however, must be careful not to pollute the environment. Sometimes rock climbers leave rubbish on the mountains where they climb. They should take it with them and throw it away. This will allow future climbers to enjoy a clean environment.",
