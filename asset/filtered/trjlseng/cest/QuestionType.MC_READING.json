Here are three hobbies for you to try.\n ◇Flower arranging（插花）\n If you like plants, think about flower arranging. Many flower shops have classes for beginners, so you can learn it in one of them. It's also a good idea to read books or visit websites. After you learn flower arranging, you can use the flowers to make gifts or make your home more beautiful.\n◇     ▲    \n Do you dream of being a writer? Well, now it is the nice time to make your dream come true. To start with, you don't need to be very good at writing. Spend some time writing something in a notebook every day. You can also try making a short story. By practicing, you can make your writing better and better.\n ◇ Painting\n Painting is a fun and relaxing thing, but many people think it is hard. In fact, it is not. At first, you may find it is not easy to draw, but it doesn't matter. The most important is that when you draw, you are enjoying the beauty of art. If you have a busy life, this is a nice hobby for you to relax yourself.\n根据材料内容选择最佳答案，",

To many people, lighting and thunder can be very frightening especially because they often happen just before a big rainstorm. Actually, having a better understanding of something can make it less frightening.\nLightning is caused by electricity building up inside a cloud. When a large amount of warm air and cold air come together high above the earth, it causes a lot of movement in the air. The cold air moves down while the warm air moves up, which creates something like friction（摩擦）. An electric charge builds up in the clouds. The charge gets stronger and stronger until the explosion（爆炸）happens ---- and the LIGHTING flashes.\nWhen the lighting flashes, the air around it becomes unbelievably hot --- fie times hotter than the surface of the sun! The heated air becomes larger and larger and gets into the cooler air around it, causing the big shock wave that we call thunder. We now know what causes lighting and thunder. Have you ever noticed that you often hear thunder just a few seconds after you see lighting? In a joke, people even said the reason was our eyes are in front of our ears! In fact, that’ because it is lighting that causes thunder. If the storm is far away from you, there are a few second between the lighting and the thunder. If the storm is close to you, you hear the thunder almost at the same time that you see the lighting.\nEven though we usually see lighting before we hear the thunder that it causes, the two events happen just a fraction（部分）of a second（瞬间）apart. In addition, both light and sound travel through the air in waves. However, light waves travel faster than sound waves, so the light waves from the explosion（爆炸声）get to us first.\nIn our daily life, something similar to lighting and thunder can happen when you brush your feet along a carpet（地毯）and then touch a doorknob. You can sometimes hear the little sizzle（咝咝声）of mini-thunder, and see the flash of mini-lightning.",

For example, a Japanese spends five hundred dollars on health care every year. However, a person in a poor country spends only three dollars a year!\nThere is another health problem in developing countries. Fifty years ago, people lived a life of about forty-six years on average(平均).Now most people in the world live twenty years longer than before. People in the poorest countries, however, live a much shorter life than people in developed countries. There are thousands of patients in poor countries; most of them are children.

A carpool is a group of people sharing the responsibility (责任) of driving to school in the morning. There are usually four or five kids in a carpool and their parents take turns to drive the kids in their cars.\nSomeone’s car smells like wet dogs. Some kids get to eat desserts (甜点) for breakfast and some parents shout so much that all you try to do is to stay quiet and go unnoticed. When your mom or dad drives the carpool, your classmates get a close-up look at how strange your parents can be. It might be your first sociological (社会学) study and your first time to work with others.\nTeamwork is really important in the carpool because nobody wants to make everyone else late. It’s a great lesson in responsibility. Imagine (想象) sitting in the car outside of a classmate’s house, watching the clock and counting the seconds. Then you start to understand how your carpool friends might feel when you are still inside the house at 7:48. You really begin to learn all your real life lessons just moments before the start of school—in the carpool.",

They wear a white coat with some black bands(条纹). Their favourite food is bamboo. However, if they are very hungry and cannot find bamboo, pandas may eat grass, fruits, or sometimes, small animals like chicken.\nPandas do not live in groups. They only leave their home from March to May to look for a mate(配偶). A mother panda usually has two babies once. Baby pandas are very small, pink and weigh about 140 grams when they are born. Mother pandas feed their babies with milk. A baby panda opens its eyes at six to seven weeks. It starts to learn how to walk when it is about three or four months old. Mother pandas look after their babies for about 18 months. Once the young is strong enough, it says goodbye to its mother and moves out to live by itself.",

They stayed outside Tiangong space station for 6.5 hours.\nWhy do astronauts go on spacewalks? That's because they need to work outside the spaceship or the space station, for example, doing science experiments. Sometimes they have to repair things. When there is something wrong with the outside of the spaceship or the space station, astronauts need to go on spacewalks to repair it. There are some ways for astronauts to train for spacewalks. One is by going for a swim. Floating (漂浮) in space is a lot like floating in water. It's more difficult than moving your body on land. Another way that astronauts train for spacewalks is by using virtual reality (VR). They wear a helmet (头盔) with a video screen inside. The screen can show a video of what they will see during the spacewalk. At the same time, they wear special gloves so that they can feel like they have been in the spacewalk.",

The Panda House is the new home to two giant pandas, China sent them to Qatar (卡塔尔) as a gift.\nThe pandas took a special plane to Qatar on October 19th. Before that, they lived at a study centre in Sichuan Province. Si Hai is a three year-old female (雌性的) panda, while Jing Jing is a four-year-old male panda. After they arrived there, they were renamed Soraya and Suhail. Both names mean \"stars in the sky\" in Arabic (阿拉伯语).\nThe Panda House is in Doba, the capital of Qatar, It covers an area of 120,000 square metres and can provide the perfect indoor climate (气候) for the pandas. China flies about 1,000 kilograms of fresh bamboo to Qatar every week to feed the two animals. A team of Chinese experts taught local keepers how to take care of the pandas. One important job for these keepers was to learn the Sichuan dialect (方言). The pandas know the dialect of their hometown very well. So communicating with them in it can help them get used to the new environment.\nIt is the first time that giant pandas have travelled from China to the Middle East. The pair will stay in Qatar for 15 years. \"This is a gift from all the Chinese to the people of Qatar for the World Cup,\" said Zhou Jian, China's ambassador (大使) to Qatar, \"It stands for the friendship between China and Qatar.\"",

They also said that in the past 100 years, as the global (全球的) temperatures went up by 0.74 ºC, the temperature in North China has gone up by 1.4 ºC in only 50 years. \nChina needs to take quick action to cut carbon dioxide emission (排放), because it’s the main reason for global warming. We plan to cut energy use by 20% and pollution emission by 10% in the 11th Five-Year Plan. \nCan you slow global warming? Sure! You and your family can take steps to cut the amount of carbon dioxide that is sent out into the air. \n\nHere are some pieces of advice to help you save the earth. Wear used clothes. Wearing your brother’s, sister’s or dad’s old T-shirts means you save the energy. \n Ride on the bus. Taking a bus saves a lot of oil every year. \n Open the window. Don’t use the air conditioner (空调), and let some fresh air in. \nWhen you have to use it, set the temperature higher in summer and lower in winter to save energy. \nMake small changes in your daily life. Don’t use paper cups, bags and boxes. \n It’s time for all of us to do something to save the earth.",

I was born in the USA and have never been to China before. I am going to study Chinese at the university.

In exchange, they get some money or other computer time.\nPaying kids for housework is one of the most popular topics, especially at a time when everyone is more careful about money. Some parents think since adults are paid to do their jobs, we should pay kids for everyday housework.\nBut some people don't think kids should get rewards(报酬) for doing housework. Susie Walton, an expert, believe that by rewarding kids, parents are sending a message that work isn't worth doing unless you get something in return. “Running any kind of housework is a team effort,” Walton said. “A home is a living space for everyone in the family. It's important for kids to see that we all have responsibilities in the house, and families decide how they want their home to look, and how they are going to keep it looking like what they want.”\nOther people believe that getting a reward encourages kids to do housework, and it also teaches them real world lessons about how we need to work to get money. There are also apps(程序) that gives kids points and digital gifts that can be redeemed(兑现) either online or in the real world. “Our goal is to give kids lawful power so they can get rewards,” says Chris Bergman. “And kids need rewards to help encourage them. ”",

However，the color of the palace itself is not purple. The color purple stands for power of the great emperors of China．It was so sacred（神圣的） that the commoners could not even dream of ever going in．\n The emperors also had some of the largest festival celebrations at the Forbidden City．During Chinese New Year，the emperor would invite all the members of his family and his officials to a banquet. The banquet had a hundred and eight Chinese dishes．It was such an expensive banquet that it could feed a commoner's family for three generations（代）．\nRight now The Forbidden City is known as a historical site for tourists from all over the world．Everyone can go in there．It is a museum with priceless Chinese antiques（古董）and treasures in it．\n I really learned a lot about the Chinese culture and its history from this trip to The Forbidden City．It was like a dream come true to go on the trip and see the things that I have always wanted to see．",

It also means accepting the responsibilities that go along with these rights.\nIn many countries, sixteen or eighteen is the age when a person becomes an adult. Young men and women at this age can get a part-time job, and begin to receive an income of their own.\nThey no longer have to depend on their parents for money all the time. In Canada and America, sixteen is the age when one can get a driving license;  in England, it is seventeen.\nThere are responsibilities that go along with both of these rights. Getting a part-time job means that you have to pay income tax. Driving a car demands that you follow certain rules like buying car insurance.\nVoting is another right that young people enjoy when they become adults. In the United States, Canada and Britain, young people have the right to vote at the age of eighteen. With this right also comes responsibility. For young people to use their right to vote wisely, they must have an understanding of the needs of society, and they must also learn how politics work.",

In 1665 he had to leave the university and go home where he made two of his great discoveries. One is that he found the colour of sunlight was made up of seven kinds.

When you hear someone say so behind you, you know that somebody wants to walk past you without touching you. It’s not polite to break others when they are talking. If you want to speak to one of them, say, “Excuse me” first, and then begin talking.

At last, only the circle around the dot was used. It was like a zero. This is one story of how the zero came to be used.\nNow zero has many important uses. Zero tells how many. Can you tell some other ways of using zero?",

We may hear of many stories about how dolphins save people out of water. \nDolphins often eat fish and some other sea animals. A dolphin with a weight of 200kg to 250kg will eat 10kg to 25kg of fish every day. They like to swim with other dolphins and usually hunt in groups. \nDolphins have very good hearing. They use it to find things under the water. Many scientists also believe dolphins can even talk to each other through a special whistle (哨声). People from different areas don’t speak the same language. Just like people, dolphins’ whistles have many kinds. One day we may understand dolphins’ whistles, and then they will be able to tell us about themselves. \n\n\nDolphins live in the sea, but they are not a kind of fish and they don’t lay eggs. They have babies in the same way as cows and cats do, and give their babies milk. A female dolphin has a baby every two to three years. \nDolphins are very friendly. Sadly, there are not many kinds of dolphins left. People killed them for many years for food and other things. Now it’s time to stop this and perhaps there will be more of them in the years to come.",
