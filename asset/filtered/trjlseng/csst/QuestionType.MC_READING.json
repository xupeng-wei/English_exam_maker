            "context": "Early rising is helpful in more than one way. First, it helps us to have good health. We all need fresh air. It makes our health better to take morning exercises. The air is never so fresh as early in the morning. Early rising helps us in our studies. In the morning we learn more quickly and find it easy to learn something by heart. Early rising makes people able to plan the work for the day. We can’t work well without a good plan. Just as the plan for the year should be made in the spring, the plan for a day should be made in the morning. Early rising gives us enough time to get ready for our work, such as to wash our hands and eat our breakfast. So the popular saying says, “Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy(富有的) and wise.”",

But when we talk about day and night, we are using “day” to mean the time between sunrise and sunset. Since the earth looks like a ball, the sun can shine on only half of it at a time. Always one half of the earth is having day and the other half night. A place is moved from day into night and from night into day over and over by the spinning（旋转）of the earth. At the equator（赤道）day and night are sometimes the same length. They are each twelve hours long. The sun rises at 6 o’clock in the morning and sets at 6 o’clock in the evening. For six months the North Pole is tilted（倾斜）toward the sun. In those months the Northern Hemisphere（半球）gets more hours of sunlight than the Southern Hemisphere. Days are longer than nights. South of the equator nights are longer than days. For the other six months the North Pole is tilted away from the sun. Then the Southern Hemisphere gets more sunlight. Days are longer than nights. North of the equator nights are longer than days. Winter is the season of long nights. Summer is the season of long days.",

He said that his daughter could hardly swim. It was really a miracle for her to escape in this way.

I couldn’t swim very well and I caught something but I didn’t know what is was,” said the girl.\n“She is really a lucky young girl,” said Alain Joyandet, France’s minister for International Cooperation.",

It is the 7th of the 24 traditional Chinese solar terms（节气）. It usually lasts for 15 days. During this period, people eat a tea egg each day.”\n“Does the egg have any special meaning?” Tiantian asked.\n“Yes. In ancient China, people believed the round egg was a symbol of a happy life. Eating eggs on the Beginning of Summer was a wish for good health. So they put tea into boiled water together with eggs and created ‘tea eggs’.”\n“It sounds interesting!

The vegetable in the garden need to be watered every day unless it rains. There is a large area of bare soil, but this needs to be watered, too. Betty planted some corn there. Please pick any vegetables that are ripe and use them. It’s a shame for them to go to waste.\n2. The garden at the front of the house only needs to be watered every two or three days. The plants there are quite strong and will survive a few days without water. The roses are starting to bloom. If you look after them, they should be all right for a week or more. They will last a bit longer if you put a little sugar in the water. That’s some advice my grandmother gave me a long time ago.\n3. There are a few plants in the pots on the porch, and these need to be watered well every day. I’ve left a couple of pots out in the sun, and these also need lots of water. You can pick any strawberries that are ripe and eat them. You’ll find they are delicious.\n4. You don’t need to do anything for the lemon tree. If you see any ripe lemons, just pick them and take them home. You can use them in cooking for to make lemonade(柠檬汁)\nThanks again for helping out. We’ll see you in two weeks. You’ve got our telephone number, so please call us if there are any problems or if you need to ask any questions. We’ll send you a post-card.",

Don’t reach for a coffee! Instead, take a nap. \nIt’s good to have a daily nap. First of all , you are more efficient（有效的） after napping . You remember things better and make fewer mistakes. Also, you can learn things more easily after taking a nap. A nap may increase your self-confidence（自信） and make you more active . It may even cheer you up. But, there are some simple rules you should follow about taking a nap. First, take a nap in the middle of day, about eight hours after you wake up. Next, a 20-minute nap is best. If you sleep longer, you may fall into a deep sleep. After waking from a deep sleep, you will feel worse. Also, you should set an alarm clock. That way, you can fully relax during your nap. You won’t have to keep looking at the clock so you don’t oversleep.\nNow，the next time you feel sleepy after lunch , don’t get stressed . Put your head down, close your eyes, and catch forty winks.",

Your roommates, as grown-ups, can do whatever they want with their time so long as it doesn’t break school rules or violate(防碍) other people’s interests. \nPlaying perhaps gives these students relaxation(放松) from hard study.

For the traffic accidents, some people lost their lives.

You can also get information about the environment on some good websites. Besides these, I have some suggestions.\nIn our everyday life, some people use less energy by sharing a car. For example, three or four persons can ride together in one car instead of driving three or four cars to work. Usually it is time-saving and convenient to share cars with their neighbors to take their children to school. Whenever we use electricity, we should tum off lights, the TV, the computer and so on when we don't use them.\nOn the other hand, we should use energy-saving products. Some products, like environment-friendly new energy cars, are made specially to save energy. These cars can travel longer than ordinary cars. They produce less pollution, too. Some products like computers and TVs with the energy star label（标签）are made to save energy.\nSecondly, we should buy recyclable products instead of non- recyclable ones.

That wasn’t fair.\nThe next day Bobby didn’t come to school. Mrs. Palmquist told us that Bobby had been very sick. He went to the doctors, but it didn’t work. Then he was put in the hospital so that they could help him get better. We were all very sad. \nThe class decided to help Bobby with his homework problem. During our free time we made Bobby cards. Each card had a special gift inside. Every student gave Bobby his or her homework pass. \nMrs. Palmquist had tears in her eyes when she realized what we had done. She told us that she was very proud of our actions and cancelled homework for one week. \nA few months later, Bobby returned to school. He was better. The doctors helped cure Bobby of his illness. Every day after his return, Bobby completed his homework. He didn’t need our gifts after all. Mrs. Palmquist told us that he used our passes every day when he was sick.

            "context": "It’s hard to believe how times have changed since the first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, on 6th April 1896. One hundred years ago, there was very little reliance (dependence) on modern technology. There were no landing mats (海绵垫), no stopwatches and no photo finishes. In fact, cameras and stopwatches were not used until the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, USA.\nToday technology has completely revolutionized (changed) sports. Take sports equipment (装备) for example. Starting blocks are now equipped with electronic pressure sensors, which, together with digital cameras, provide exactly correct race time and also help to catch runners who “jump the gun”. As athletes cross the finishing line, special digital cameras can also easily decide the winner. The days of “dead heats” are gone. \nAthletes have also benefited (受益) from technological developments. Body-hugging suits, which reduce (减少) wind drag, can help cut up to one-tenth of a second from runners’ race times. Top athletes are even provided with tailor-made sports shoes. These shoes are made to fit the athlete exactly -- and there are even air compartments in the shoes that can be filled to meet each runner’s individual needs.\nTechnology has also changed the way that many sports are performed. Take one example -- the pole vault (撑杆跳). The inclusion of a landing mat obviously made a big difference to the vaulting style (方式) as athletes no longer needed to worry about hurting themselves as they fell. Without these worries, athletes could obviously jump higher. These days, pole vaulters do not even need to worry about the crossbar as the uprights are now fitted with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that measure (测量) how high the athlete vaulted. Even it has been to the advantage of swimmers. New pools have been designed to reduce wave interference and sports scientists have even developed a new style of swimming that increases buoyancy and reduces drag in the water.\nThe increasing importance of these technological developments has led many sportsmen to suggest that the “Olympic spirit” is being lost in a rush to break records and win medals. Many developing countries say that technology has become too important in sport and that athletes from developing countries that cannot afford such technology are disadvantaged. There are no easy answers but one thing is sure -- we cannot turn back times. Technology cannot go backwards.",
