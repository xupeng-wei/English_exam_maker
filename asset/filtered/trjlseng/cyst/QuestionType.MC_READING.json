Would you take it?\nStudents at Shenzhen Luohu Foreign Language Middle School have learned to keep themselves safe by saying “no”. In fact, what those strangers want to give them are drugs (毒品). Drugs are dangerous to your health!\n“Because teens don’t know much about drugs, they might want to try them,” said Zhang Dongsheng, the director of Shenzhen Drug Control Office.\nNow, many schools arrange (安排) courses or organize some activities to help students know about drugs.\nLiang, 16, was a good student before trying drugs. One day, some old friends told him it would be fun. After taking drugs only once, he found it very hard to stop. Liang began to spend all his time and money on drugs. Soon, he stopped going to school and started stealing (偷窃). In the end, he was put in prison.\nIn China, taking drugs is becoming a big problem for teens. According to a survey, about one million people in China were using illegal (违法) drugs last year, and 72% of them were young people. Worse still, there are about 10,000 drug users under 16 now.\nZhang has some good advice on staying clean. He said, “Drugs are dangerous. Never try them, even if you’re curious! It is the most important for you to keep safe and healthy.”",

Some spacemen like to float in the air, but most like to be in a sleeping bag. They tie(捆) the bag to a wall so that they won’t float away at night.        \n Exercise is very important in space. On Earth, your legs carry your body, but in space, spacemen float, so they do not use their legs often. This is very bad for their legs, so they must exercise for thirty minutes every day.  \n After a day’s work, spacemen can enjoy themselves.

They were the symbol(象征) of the emperor of China.\nRobert: What about in other countries?\nDenise: In many traditional European stories, dragons are cruel and dangerous! European dragons could fly and could breathe fire from their mouths. They also liked to catch and eat beautiful girls.

It's also famous in China. It was the symbol of the queen of China. The phoenix never died, but every 500years it had to fly into a fire. The fire gave the phoenix a new life.\nRobert: What's that you're drawing?\nDenise: This is a griffin. It has the head and wings of an eagle(鹰) and the body of a lion. It protected kings and queens in Europe. This horse with wings is called Pegasus.\nRobert: Cool! I can’t wait to see these kites in the sky. People will think they're real.

But how many of us actually sit down to do this?\n“People don't seem to walk around giving thanks to people quite often,\"Amit Kumar from University of Texas said. Why are people hesitant (犹豫) about sending thank-you notes? And how do people feel when they receive one?\nKumar and his team asked some students to write a thank-you note to another person by e-mail.Then, they asked both the writer and the recipient (接受者) how sending or receiving these notes made them feel.\nThey found that the students didn't like to write the notes because they felt like they had to think too much about them. They worried about what to say and how to say it.\nThe recipients, however,enjoyed the notes. \"When you are a recipient, you focus on the warmth of the note,\" Kumar says. \"How heartfelt was it? How friendly and sweet?\"The writers also thought it might be awkward (尴尬的) for the recipient to receive a thank-you note. But this was not the fact.\n“They (recipients) feel quite happy,\"Kumar says. \"They don't really feel awkward at all.\"“If people knew that writing a thank-you note could have such a big influence (影响) on others.they would do it more often,\"Kumar says.\n“Simple, small changes in our everyday lives can make a big difference in how we treat other people and how we feel,\" he says.\nThen how to write a thank-you note? Would you please put the following into the right order (顺序)？\n①Second thank you. A sentence (句子) that says thanks again.\n②Closing and signature. Say “with love\", or “best wishes\". Then sign your name.\n③The details (细节). Write the thing you are thankful for. A few sentences will do.\n④First thank you. A short sentence that thanks the giver,such as “Thanks for the great birthday gift\".\n⑤Greeting, “Dear (name of recipient)\" is often used,\"Hi\" is also OK.",

The person's not asking for your money, but your fingers.\n In the US, \"give me five\" or \"give me the high five\" is a popular gesture (动作). You can see it often in films or on TV. It means the slapping (拍) of each other's raised (举起的) right hands together.\n People do it when they meet for the first time or something happy happens. For example, a student has good marks in exams or wins a lottery ticket (彩票).If a football team wins a game, the players will give high fives to everyone around to celebrate.\n This gesture may come from the old Roman gesture of raising the right arm for the emperor(皇帝). This showed that the person raising his arm did not have a sword (刀) in his hand.\n Why not try to give the high five to your friends?",

Always do something for others. Help those in trouble and care about the people around you. If everyone did the same, what a wonderful world this would be! Thirdly, one must have the ability to work with others. Cooperation and communication（合作和交流）are two important keys to better human relations . Everyone needs friends because no one can live through life alone or do everything he wants to.\nBesides the examples above ,patriotism is the one we should never forget. Patriotism means a love of one’s country. It is one of the highest qualities of human’s. Everyone should love his own country. But people sometimes think that patriots(爱国者)must be fighters or that they live in a time of fighting for their country. That is wrong. A good youth’s work is not only fighting. A good youth will do the things his country asks him to do.\nI think a good youth of today should also have some training in art.

Just be clever and try to get away from it quickly!\nSome junior boys and girls from Beijing Yuren Middle School learnt this month. Their teacher gave them a lesson on how to keep themselves safe.\nMany students say this kind of thing has happened to them.\nLi Yunli is a girl student. When she was on a crowed bus last month, she felt someone touching her. A man leant（靠） on her body and put his hands on her leg! Li was so afraid. She couldn't say a word and just moved away.\nZhao Li, 12, is a boy. He likes to chat on the Internet. But once a stranger said lots of dirty things to him. Zhao was so surprised! He quickly stopped chatting with the man.\nWhat can students do when this kind of thing happens?\nHere are some tips from Jiulong Middle School's teacher and students:\n1. Don't be afraid. Ask him or her to stop at once. If he or she doesn't listen, try to turn to other around you and call for help. \n2. Keep calm. Be serious and keep a cool face. Say you don't like it and show you are angry.\n3. If there is no one around, use clever ways. If you only shout or fight to make them angry, it could make things worse! They may take your life. Find excuses to run away. Say things like you are waiting for your parents or you want to go to the washroom.",

You will have the chance to travel to many different places and meet a lot of different people. That will open up your eyes.\nHowever, there are also disadvantages of being a professional musician. One of the biggest disadvantages for most musicians is that they don't always have enough money. Most of the time, you will be looking for jobs. Sometimes you won't be able to find a good job. Another disadvantage is the place you live in. If you want to be a musician, you usually have to move to an area that has a lot of jobs, such as New York City. The cost of living in these areas is usually very high. The third disadvantage is that you can't have a stable family life. Different jobs will take a musician to different places, so most musicians are unable to have a regular family.",

And how interesting it was when the Chinese astronauts told us about what they had seen on the trip! It’s time to get excited again. Shenzhou VII is just around the corner!\nEarlier several months ago, Chinese space scientists announced that Shenzhou VII will be sent up in 2008.\n“All our work on Shenzhou VII is going well,” said Qi Faren, former (前任的) chief designer of the Shenzhou spaceship.\nWill Shenzhou VII be sent up in time for the 2008 Beijing Olympics? Scientists say no. They say the timing of the mission (任务) depends on when they finish designing the spacesuit.\nShenzhou VII will take three astronauts into space. It will travel around the Earth for up to five days. At least one of the astronauts will do a spacewalk. Who will fly? Who will the astronauts be? Yang Liwei, Fei Junlong and Nie Haisheng, who have all made trips into space in the past few years, are all competing for a place. But it seems that it’s unfair for women astronauts.\nWhat about Chinese space exploration in the future?\nAfter the Shenzhou VII flight China will build a space lab and then a space station. Chinese astronauts will then be able to do experiments in space.\nWhat’s special about the Shenzhou VII spacesuit?\nChinese spacewalkers will wear 160 million yuan spacesuits. Each weighs about 100 kilograms on Earth. The Shenzhou VII spacesuit is heavier and more complicated (复杂的) than the suits the Shenzhou V and VI astronauts used.\nSpacewalks need other equipment (设备) too for astronauts to be able to work outside the spacecraft.",

When he passed by a flower shop in the evening, an idea came to his mind, “I’ll send Mum some roses.” While John was picking his flowers, a young man went inside. “How many roses can I get for only five dollars, madam?” he asked. The assistant was trying to tell him roses were as expensive as forty dollars a dozen(一打).Maybe he would be happy with carnations(康乃馨).\n“No, I have to have red roses,” he said. “My mum was badly ill last year and I didn’t get to spend much time with her. Now I want to get something special, it has to be roses as rose is her favorite.”\nAfter hearing it, John said he would pay the rest of the money for the young man. Moved by both of them, the assistant said, “Well, lovely young men, thirty dollars a dozen, only for you.” Taking the roses, the young man almost jumped into the air and ran out of the shop. It was well worth twenty--five dollars that John paid to see the exciting moment. Then John paid for his dozen of roses and told the assistant to send them to his mother.\nAs he walked out, he felt nice. Suddenly he saw the young man crossing the street and going into a park. But soon John realized it was not a park but a cemetery(墓地). Crying, the young man carefully put down the roses, “Mum, oh, Mum, why didn’t I tell you how much I loved you? God, please help me find my mum and tell her I love her.”\nSeeing this, John turned and quickly walked to the shop. He would take the flowers home himself.",
