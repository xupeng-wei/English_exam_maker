A 35 is coming!” he shouted, trying to wake the little man up. “Get up! Get up! Tie (捆，绑) things down 36 they blow away!”\nThe little man didn’t move, saying in a sleepy voice, “No sir, I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows.” \nThe farmer got very 37 and decided to make the little man go at once. Instead he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. How 38! He found that the little man had got everything ready. Nothing could blow away.\nAll of a sudden, the farmer 39 his worker’s words, so he returned to his bed while the wind blew.\nSo, if you are prepared, in either body or mind, you have 40 to be afraid of.\nCan you sleep when the wind blows through your life?",
