Next time I would like to go with you if you want. John: Sure. By the way, do you like sports? Mary: No, not at all. I even hated sports when I was young. Tom, you used to like soccer very much, didn't you? Tom: Yes, but now I have no time to play so I don't love it anymore. Now I prefer reading books. Mary, I will return the books to you soon. I know you read books every day. Mary: OK. I have another book to read now so don't worry about it. Tom: Thanks a lot. You know I used to watch TV almost every night but now I don't.

You'd better not go out.外面很冷,你最好不要出去.\n2.在let,make,see, feel, watch,hear等感官或使役动词后,要跟不带to的动词不定式作宾语补足语.例如:\nI made them give me the money back.我迫使他们把钱还给我.\nI didn't see you come in.我没看见你进来.\n3.在引导疑问句的why not之后.\n\"Why not+不带to的不定式\"是Why don't you do…的省略,可以用来提出建议或劝告.例如:\nWhy not go with us.为什么不和我们一起去呢.\nWhy not take a holiday.=Why don't you take a holiday.为什么不休个假呢.\n三.动词不定式作 <blank> _\n不定式结构作主语时,现代英语倾向于采用it作形式主语,而把不定式结构后置的形式.\n四,动词不定式作定语\n不定式作定语,要放在它所修饰的名词或代词的后面.例如:\nI have nothing to say on this question.对这个问题我无可奉告.\n五.动词不定式作宾语\n有的及物动词要求跟复合宾语(即宾语+宾语补足语).如果其中的宾语是不定式短语,则必须将形式宾语it放在宾语的位置上,而将不定式短语(真正的宾语)放在宾语补足语之前.例如:\nI find it useful to learn English well.我发现学好英语很有用.\nWe thought it wrong not to tell her.我们认为不告诉她是错误的.\n六.动词不定式作宾语补足语\n动词不定式作宾语补足语是动词不定式用法的一个重点,学习时要注意以下三种情况:\n1.作动词ask, like, tell等的宾语补足语时,动词不定式符号to不可以省略.例如:\nHe asked me to talk about English study.他请我谈谈英语学习.\n2.作使役动词let, have, make以及感官动词feel, hear, see, watch等的宾语补足语时,动词不定式符号to要省略.例如:\nThe teacher made him say the word like this.老师让他像这样说这个单词.\n3.作动词help的宾语补足语时,动词不定式符号to可以带,也可以不带.例如:\nCould you help me (to) carry the heavy box.你能帮我搬这个重箱子吗.\n七.动词不定式作状语\n动词不定式及其短语具有副词的特性,可在句中用作状语.\n1.放在句首也可以放在句尾表示目的等.例如: He stopped to have a rest.他停下来休息.\n2.跟在作表语的形容词或过去分词的后面.例如:\nI'm sorry to hear that.听到这事我感到很难过.\n3.用在too... to...结构中.例如:\nHe is too young to understand all that.他太年轻了,不能理解这件事.",

The more people, the more pollution. Many years ago, the problem was not so serious because there were not so many people.
