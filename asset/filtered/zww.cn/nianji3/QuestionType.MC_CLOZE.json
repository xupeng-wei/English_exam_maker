The person who asks \"How are you?\" hopes to hear the answer \"<blank text=4>\", even though the person's friend isn't fine, <blank text=5> \"How are you?\" isn't really a question, and \"Fine\" isn't really an answer.

It is in fact more than 6,000 kilometres long. It is 4-5 metres wide. In most places, five horses or ten men can walk side by side.\nWhen you visit the Great Wall,you can't help wondering how the Chinese people were able to build such a great wall thousands of years ago. Witho -ut any modern machine, it was really very difficult to build it. They had to do all the work by hand.It took millions of men hundreds of years\nto build it.\nThe Great Wall has a history of over two thousand years. The kings began to build the first parts of it around two thousand seven hundred years ago. Then Qin Shihuang had all the walls joined up.

He was busy getting ready to welcome a famous writer, who had been <blank> to come to give a talk on novels at the public library that very evening. Since I happened to have read a book or two by this famous writer, when Tom asked me to go with him, I <blank> accepted. Tom was going to introduce the writer to the audience. So we went to the library a little <blank> to welcome him. <blank> the writer hadn't arrived yet, I left Tom and went into the reading room. A large number of people had already been there. I was sorry to find that I didn't know a single person. So I found a <blank> in the corner and sat quietly waiting. When it was just about time for the <blank> to begin, I saw Tom standing at the door making a sign for <blank> to come out. He looked <blank> something, so I got up right away and went to him. He said that he had just had a telephone call from the writer. He had <blank> his flight and would not be arriving! <blank> we were thinking about the problem, Tom suddenly asked me if I <blank> mind giving a talk instead of the writer. I <blank> had time to think about it when all at once I found I was being pushed back into the reading room to <blank> to the waiting audience!",

I'm going to play the piece of music in a few minutes, but (40) <blank> I do, you need to get a pencil and a piece of paper, as I'm going to give you some (41) <blank> which should make your job a little easier. Are you ready? Right. Now listen carefully, as you might be this week's (42) <blank> winner.\nAlthough the person who wrote the music was born in Italy, he spent most of his (43) <blank> in Spain. Have you got that? On to the second point: There is also a (44) <blank> play which has the same title(标题) as this music and which is usually performed in the open air in the summer. Any (45) <blank> yet? I should warn you that it's not that easy. Now for the next point: When this piece of music was first performed, many people in the audience got up and (46) <blank>. They thought the music was terrible and said it was a waste of their money. It's (47) <blank> really, when you think how (48) <blank> it is today. And now for the last point. Part of his music has been used for an advertisement which you can see on (49) <blank>, in a lot of magazines and even on your cinema screen from next month. I'm sure when you hear the music, you'll know what the advertisement is (50) <blank>. I'm not going to tell you what product(产品) it is, because that would almost give you the answer!\nSo, that's four things to remember. If you can give us the answer, please ring .

To begin with, she spoke too quickly, and I couldn't 3 every word. Later on, I realized it doesn't matter if you don't understand every word, I was also afraid 4 in class because I thought my classmates might laugh 5me. I couldn't always make complete sentences, either. Then I started to 6 English-language TV. It helped a lot. I think that 7lots of listening practice is one of the secrets of 8a good language learner. Another thing that I found very difficult was English 9. So I decided to take lots of grammar notes in every class.Now I'm enjoying10 English and got 11A this term. My teacher is very 12",

After many tries, we did better.\nSwimming was my favourite class. It was about one o'clock, the  7  time of a day and the best time to stay in the cool water. The swimming teacher was an interesting man. During class he often made us  8  happily with our mouths wide open. He taught us how to swim under the water.\nA week 9  before we knew it.

As soon as I started my lesson writing on the blackboard, I heard some noise from the back. I <blank text=49> the students to find out who did it, but the class looked very <blank text=50>. I went on writing and the noise went on. Then I stopped my lesson to <blank text=51> this problem because I believed that if I lost control (控制) of the class from the <blank text=52> I wouldn't be able to get it back. I thought the big boy made the noise. To my <blank text=53>, a small boy was the source (根源) of trouble.

Then he jumped up from his chair.\"I shall make a glass like that,\"he cried,\"I shall make a 46 one. Not only I can see the girls' faces with my own eyes, but 47 the new glassed, perhaps I shall see the face of the moon.\" He began to work at once. He didn't need to go to see Lippershey's glass. The idea was 48 for him, and very soon his own glass was ready. He gave it a name\"The telescope\"(from the Greek words for \"far\"an\"see\"). Lippershey could see 49 the land, but Galileo could see across the sky. When it was ready, Galileo looked through it at the moon. He was 50 surprised  to speak. He could see the moon's face clearly.

Second, I couldn\"t fix the other parts of the cell on to the cell wall. The cement was too hard! Third, I wanted to use the tape to give names to the parts, but it would not stick(粘)to the cement.\nThere was <blank text=46> I could do about the first problem. For the second problem, I put a wire around the cell and used glue to stick parts on to it. I used paint to name the parts. These was one more problem. The cell had to be full of clear water, <blank text=47> real cells. I filled it <blank text=48> water and brought it to school, but soon the table was wet. I checked <blank text=49>. The bottom of the cell had a hole in it!\nThat day, I got a C on my homework.
