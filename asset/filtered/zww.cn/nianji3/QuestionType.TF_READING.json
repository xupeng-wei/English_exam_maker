One day a mouse came into the garage and played on the floor. He stopped drawing and watched the mouse. The mouse came towards him, so he gave the mouse a piece of bread. Day after day they became good friends.\nSome years later, Disney moved to the west coast of the USA. He tried to get work as an artist, but still he was unsuccessful. One day he remembered the mouse that used to come out in his father's garage. He picked up his pencil and started to draw. At last he was pleased with one of his pictures of the mouse. He called it Mickey Mouse.\nHis success as a cartoon-maker had begun. He made scores of cartoons. All of them were liked very much by children. He died in 1966.

' I know a lot of people think it is wrong to keep animals in zoos. However, I believe that zoos have many good points.\nFirstly, zoos are places for people to see many different kinds of animals from all over the world. Without zoos, most people would never see a real bear or tiger.\nSecondly, zoos look after the animals very well. The animals are always given food and cleaned regularly (定期). In the wild, it is not always possible for an animal to find food, so sometimes it goes hungry. But animals kept in zoos never go hungry.\nThirdly, zoos protect the animals they look after. They offer them safe places to live in. In the wild, some kinds of animals are in danger of becoming extinct(灭期).But zoos give these animals a chance (机会)to live. Without zoos, there would be fewer kinds of animals in the world.\nMaria Smith\nZoos Are Unnatural\nIn Maria's letter, she says that zoos are good for animals. I am afraid that zoos are not good for animals, they are only, good for people.\nIt is unnatural(非自然的)and unfair to keep wild animals in cages(笼子).Most animals are kept in cages that are too small for them. In 'the wild, these animals\nwould travel freely. In zoos, they can't do this. This is why the bears and tigers always look so sad.\nMost cages are not very clean either. It is true that zoos give the animals food regularly, but this is not natural. Wild animals are used to looking for their own. food. We should treat(对待)animals in the same way that we treat other people-with respect.\nWould anyone be happy if you don't let him go outside his home? Would Maria like to have lots of people. standing outside her flat looking at her? No, she wouldn't.\nAnd animals don't like it either.\nPhilip Black",

You may find out what they are if you watch someone make friends.\nHere is how one new teacher made friends with the students in her class on the first day of the school. When the bell rang, the teacher smiled at all the students. Then she said,\" Good morning. How nice it is to have all of you in my class this year! I want to know each of you very much. I am sure we will enjoy working together.\"\nThe teacher smiled, used a pleasant voice, and acted in a friendly way. She told the students her name and wrote it on the blackboard. Then she told them something she liked to do and hoped to do with them during the year. The students knew that she liked many of the things they liked. Everyone felt that she meant what she said. Each of them wanted to know her better and be her friend.\nThen she let the students tell something about themselves. So they felt that the teacher knew them. Could you make friends as the teacher did?\nHow do you get to know your classmates? One way is to find out more about them. During the break you can talk to them. You may ask them their names and the names of the schools they went to last year. They want to know about you, too. You may tell them about your interests or your holiday experiences. It is often easy to be friends with whom people have the same interests and play the same games. As you talk, the others may think,\" I like to do the same things you do. It would be fun to be friends with you.\"\nRemember! Just talking together in a friendly way is one good way to make friends.",

            "context": "(C)\nDays Gone By\nMichael took a very special trip last month. He went back to Fullerton, his home town. Michael's visit to Fullerton was very special to him. He was born there, he grew up there, but he hadn't been back there since he finished high school.\nHe went to places he hadn't gone to in years. He walked through the park in the center of town and remembered the days he had walked through that same park with his girlfriend. He passed by the empty field where he and his friends had played baseball every day after school. And he stood for a while in front of the movie theater and thought about all the Saturday afternoons he had spent there sitting in the balcony, watching his favorite movie heroes and eating popcorn.\nHe did things he hadn't done in a long time. He had some homemade ice cream at the ice cream shop. He rode on the merry-go-round in the park, and he went fishing at the lake on the outskirts of town. For a little while, he felt like a kid again. He hadn't had homemade ice cream, ridden on a merry-go-round, or gone fishing since he was a young boy.\nHe also saw people he hadn't seen in years. He visited several of his old neighbors who had never moved out of the neighborhood. He said hello to the owners of the candy store near his houses. And he even bumped into Mrs. Riley, his tenth-grade science teacher.\nDuring his visit to his hometown, Michael remembered places he hadn't gone to, things he hadn't done, and people he hadn't seen since his childhood. Michael's trip back to Fullerton was a very nostalgic experience for him. Going back to Fullerton brought back many memories of days gone by. Answer True, False, or Maybe (if the answer isn't in the story)",

The first computer was built at Harvard University(哈佛大学) in 1944. it was as large as a room and quite difficult and slow to operate(运行). But since the invention of the silicon chip(硅片), computer have become smaller, easier to use, and faster to operate. Some computers are as small as television sets. Some computers can be made smaller than a book. And computers are getting smaller all the time. There are several reasons(原因) why computer is useful to us. First it can store(储藏) very, very large amount(数量) of information(信息). Second, the computer can operate very quickly. Third, modern computer can be built into other kinds of machines, like radios, cars, and planes. They can do a lot of work for us. Soon, almost everyone, either at home or at work, will use some kind of computer. The lives of all of us will be changed by this invention.",

Isaac Newton continues to study at home. He enjoys physics and thinking about the mysteries of the world.\nOn a day when there is rain and sun at the same time he sees a beautiful rainbow in the sky. It has many different colours, he is told that there are five. Newton wants to have his own rainbow because he wants to look at it closely. He decides to do an experiment. On a sunny day he goes inside a small room and he makes the room very dark. Then he makes a small hole and the sun comes inside, it's a small ray of light. It's white. Newton takes a prism and holds it up to the light. The ray of light goes through the prism, but it isn't white now – there are many colours. The prism has split up(分解)the white light into different colours: Newton has a rainbow.\nNewton looks at his rainbow carefully. He can see more than five colours, he can see seven. He says the colours are: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.\nBut Newton is a scientist and he's always very interested in how things work. He has his rainbow but he wants to know more. So he takes another prism and holds it up to the rainbow. The rainbow goes through the second prism, but it isn't colourful now – it's white again. The prism has joined up the colours back into white light. Newton is the first person to understand that light is a combination of all the rainbow colours together.\nNewton also understands how we can see colour. Imagine a leaf in the sunshine. All the rainbow colours fall on the leaf but it absorbs all these colours. The only colour that is reflected(反射) is green, so the leaf looks green. Different objects reflect different colours. And perhaps Newton's favourite fruit is an orange – but what came first, the name of the fruit or the name of the colour?",

Fred Baines was such a student. He spent more time drinking in the Tea House than working in the library. Once at the end of the term, we had to take an important test in Chinese. The test had 100 questions. Beside each question we had to write \"True\" or \"False\". While I was studying in my room the night before  a test, Fred was watching TV. Fred usually worried a lot the night before\n a test. But on that night he looked very easy. Then he told me of his idea. \"It's very simple. There are 100 questions and I have to get 50 right to pass the test. I'll take a coin into the room. I haven't studied a Chinese book for months, so I'll toss(掷,扔)the coin. In that way, I'm sure I'll get half of the questions right.\" The next day, Fred came happily into the examination room. As he sat tossing a coin for half an hour, he wrote down his answers. Then he left, half an hour before the rest of us. The next day, Fred met his Chinese teacher at the school gate. \"Oh, good, \"he said. \"Have you got the results of the test?\" The teacher looked at him and smiled, \"Ah, it's you, Baines. Just a minute.\" Then the teacher reached his pocket and took out a coin. He threw it into the air, caught in his hand and looked at it. \"I'm sorry, Baines, you failed!\"",

They lose their leaves and die. Thousands of trees burn in forest fires, and many others die from lack of(缺乏)water. People cut down thousands more to build houses or to make furniture.\nAmericans think that trees are important. After a forest fire they plant new trees to replace the old ones, and the men who cut down trees often plant other trees in the same places.\nEvery spring there is a special day for planting new trees. This day is called Arbor Day. School children learn about trees, and on Arbor Day they plant a tree near the school.\nJanet goes to school in Memphis, Tennessee. She is in the sixth grade and likes her teacher ,Miss Swan, very much. Today it is a beautiful spring day. It is also Arbor Day. Miss Swan is taking the children outside. She has a beautiful young tree ready to plant, and all the children are going to help. They make a deep hole and plant the tree between the building and the street.

He found that the girls who milked cows never caught smallpox and he began to think why. Many of them caught a disease (疾病) from the cow called cowpox (牛痘). It was not serious (严重的) and they recovered from it quickly. Once they had had cowpox, they were safe from catching smallpox.\nOne day a girl came to see him. She had cowpox. Jenner took some of the germs (病菌) of the cowpox from her hand. He then found a little boy of eight called Jimmy. He made a small scratch (刮破) on his arm. Into the scratch he put some of the germs of the cowpox. Jimmy caught cowpox and soon got better, but later, when he came near people who had smallpox he did not catch it, while other people did.\nJenner was very happy about what he had found. He wrote a paper for other doctors to read. At first they would not believe (相信) what he had written was true.\nJenner became a great hero (英雄), but he still worked as a village doctor. He visited London quite often, but he always went back to his village home as soon as he could.

One day, just before Christmas, we decided to stop working earlier because we had sold out all our meat, except one small turkey (火鸡). When I was going to close the door, a woman rushed in and said that she wanted a big turkey. The manager tried to sell her the small one. ''It's too small,'' she said. The manager said he would get another one and went to the back of the shop with the turkey. I went after him to see what he was going to do. He pulled the small turkey to make it look bigger, and then came back and said, ''Here is a bigger one.''''Yes,'' the woman said, ''But not much bigger. I'll take both of them.''",

People play different games in winter and summer. Swimming is fun in warm weather, but skating is good in winter.\nSome sports are so interesting that people everywhere go in for them. Football, for example, has spread around the world. Swimming is popular in all countries near the sea or in those with many rivers.

At that time, computers were large and expensive. Computer networks didn't work well. If one computer in the network broke down, then the whole network stopped. So a new network system had to be set up. It should be good enough to be used by many different computers. If part of the network was not working, information could be sent through another part. In this way computer network system would keep on working all the time.\nAt first the Internet was only used by the government, but, in the early 1970s, universities, hospital and banks were allowed to use it too. However, computers were still very expensive and the Internet was difficult to use. By the start of the 1990s, computers became cheaper and easier to use. Scientists had also developed software the made \"surfing\" the Internet more convenient.\nToday it is easy to get on-line and it is said that millions of people use the Internet every day. Sending e-mail is more and more popular among students.\nThe Internet has now become one of the most important parts of people's life.",

Some people find exam time so bad that they become ill, because they are afraid of falling;they are afraid of letting their parents and family down. If exams are really making you ill or worried, don't hide your feelings. Talk to someone about it. If one person doesn't help you, ask someone else.\nHow to get through exams? Here are some top tips by educational psychologists (教育心理学家):\nl Ask a teacher or tutor about how to revise, and exam skills―how to work when you are in an exam.\nl Take short rests during your time of work and revision. If your mind is tired, it will not remember well.\nl Plan your work: revise at times when you know you will work at your best.\nl Get enough sleep, and eat healthy food.\nl If you fell ill, talk to someone about your worries. But don't be too relaxed! Some stress over exams makes you work hard for them.\nl If it upsets you to talk to your friends about an exam when it is finished, don't do it! In fact, don't even think about the exam you have finished. What is done is done. You cannot change what you have written!\nTo this advice, we would add:\nIf you are studying in the evening, don't go straight to be bed afterwards. Your mind will still be \"going round and round\"--- thinking too much. Do something else, maybe walk or get exercise. Choose something that will relax you, and make you think of other things.",

So the land is a better are problems for plants living on land. One is water. Plants need water to grow. They get water mostly in the form of rain. Some plants, however, need a great deal of water. Others need very little. Heat is another problem. Not all plants need the same amount of heat in order to grow properly. The amount of rainfall and heat change from place to place. For these reasons, different parts of the earth have their own kinds of plant life.
