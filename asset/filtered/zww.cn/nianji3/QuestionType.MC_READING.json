Thirty children tried to think about not only what they had done, but also what our teacher might have found out.\n\"Who did this?\"she asked again. She wasn't really asking, she was demanding an answer. She never became angry, but she was this time. She held up a piece of broken glass and asked, \"Who broke this window?\"\n\"Oh, oh,\"I thought. I was the one who broke the window. I did not do it on purpose. It was caused by a bad throw of a baseball. Why did it have to be me?\nIf I admitted it, I would be in a lot of trouble. How would I be able to pay for a big window like that? \"My father is going to get mad at me,\"I thought. I didn't want to raise my hand, but some force much stronger than me pulled it up. \"I did it.\"Then I was silent. It was hard enough saying what I had.\nMy teacher went to one of our library shelves and took down a book. She then began walking towards my desk. I had never known my teacher to strike a student, but I feared she was going to start with me.\n\"I know how you like birds, Henry.\"She said as she stood looking down at my face. \"Here is that field guide about birds that you are always checking out. It is yours. We got a new one for the school anyway. You will not be punished. But remember, it's only for your truthfulness.\"\nI couldn't believe it! I wasn't being punished and I was getting my very own bird field guide. The very one that I had been saving up all my money to buy.",

Its secret is a set of magnets(磁铁)built into the bed and floor, which are powerful enough to support almost 900 kilograms.\nInventor: Janjaap Ruijssenaars\nPrice: US $ 1.5 million\n\nA plate of coffee\n\"Don't spill(洒)it!\"many mums shout to teens drinking coffee, because coffee stains are difficult to wash away. Spanish inventor Ferran Adria's latest invention may save teenagers from nagging(唠叨). Solid coffee is made by combining coffee with sugar. The mixture is like cream and you eat it with a spoon. The solid coffee has been found in the US since September, 2006 and comes in several different tastes.\nInventor: Ferran Adria\nAvailable at Lavazza in Chicago for US $ 2.49\n\nHand―free hug(拥抱)\nWhen you're away from home and miss your parents' hugs, Hug Shirt now can help send them to you.\nWhen your mum sends you a hug, your cellphone sends a signal to the Hug Shirt.

They are touched by the morals(道德) in the shows. These include (包含)the importance of respecting elders and social order. Though some people think South Korean TV series are too slow and too long, most of the Chinese audiences like them. Maybe we are really tired of(厌倦) Western TV series.

A large number of trees are being cut down to make paper. If everyone uses paper carelessly, soon we would not have any trees left. Other things are also being wasted, and people don't know what to do with the waste in big cities. So it is necessary to reduce the amount(数量) of waste we produce.\nReuseYou should always think of reusing things before throwing them out. For example, give the clothes you do not use or the ones that are too small to the poor. In a family, you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters.\nRecycleBottles, cans(罐头) and paper can easily be recycled. By doing so we save lots of time and money. For example, coke cans are sent to a factory, where they are smashed flat and melted. The metal can be used to make new coke cans.\nRecoverWhen you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten(腐烂的) ones. You have two choices: one is to throw the apples away; the second is to throw the rotten ones and keep the good ones. In this way, you are recovering the eatable parts of food.\nRepairIf one of the legs of your table is broken, you should repair it. If you want to buy something newer and better, it is better for you to sell the old thing, or give it to people who can use it after repairing it.\nLearn the rules to protect our environment. Let's try our best to make the earth cleaner and more beautiful.",

If a friend\nof yours asks you to have lunch with him, you may say something like this, \"I'm\nafraid it'll have to be someplace cheap, as I have very little money.\" The other\nperson may say, \"OK, I'll meet you at McDonald's.\"\nThis means that the two agree to go Dutch, that is, each person pays for\nhimself. He may also say, \"Oh, no. I want to take you to lunch at Smith's,\" or \"I\nwant you to try the Chinese dumplings there. They're great.\" This means the\nperson wants to pay for both of you. If you feel friendly towards this person, you\ncan go with him and you needn't pay for the meal. You may just say, \"Thank you.\nThat would be very nice.\"\nAmerican customs(风俗) about who pays for dates(约会) are much the\nsame as in other parts of the world. In the old days, American women wanted men\nto pay for all the meals. But, today, a university(大学) girl or a woman in\nbusiness world will usually pay her way during the day. If a man asks her for a\ndance outside the working hours, it means \"Come, as my guest(客人).\" So as\nyou can see, it is a polite thing to make the question clear at the very beginning.",

They soon went on to other countries in the south and southeast Asia as well as East Africa.\nTsunamis are especially dangerous for children. By Wednesday, nearly 60000 people died because of the tsunamis. 30% of them were children, and most of them were 5 to 12 years old.\nIn open seas tsunamis are only one or two metres high. When they are near land, they are as high as 10 meters. Houses and cars near the sea can be taken away by these big waves. Because tsunamis move fast and can travel to another side of the sea within one day, they may affect(影响) a lot of places.\nThe Pacific Ocean (太平洋)has a lot of strong tsunamis because of the size of ocean and large earthquakes there. China doesn't see tsunamis often because its sea floor is quite flat(平的). Islands around China also help the country avoid from them.\nWhat should you do when there's a tsunamis? Move to a safe place. If you are near the sea and you feel the earth shake, move to higher ground. Stay away from rivers and streams(溪流).\nReported by \"China Daily\" on Friday, December 31st,2004",

This book is a journal I wrote last month for a very special competition. I won the first prize, which was that my book would become part of the first ever experiment in time travel. It would be put in a timecapsuleto be sent back almost fifty years into the past. So, if everything went according to plan, you should be reading this in about the year 2005.\nDo you know what timecapsulesare? They are usually containers made of some very strong material �C so strong that it should last for hundreds or thousands of years without being destroyed. Inside these containers, you put things that are typical of the place in which you live. For example, in 2005 you might put a copy of a popular comic, a CD by a famous musician, videos of television programmes �C all sorts of things. The idea is that when people in another century open up the time capsule. They'll be able to see what life was like in the past.\nUntil now, all timecapsuleshave been left for people in the future to find. This one is the first that has been sent from the future to the past. I don't understand how it's going to be done, but I think it's a really cool idea. If it works, my own grandparents will be able to read this when they were secondary school students!But if my grandparents did read this, why haven't they ever mentioned it to me?",

Hanna changed her name to Anne because she thought it would be easier for people to remember. On the other hand, Joseph is thinking about changing his name to an unusual name because she wants to be different.\nPeople have a lot of reasons for changing their names. Film stars, singers, sportsmen and some other famous people often change their names because they want names that are not ordinary, or that have special sound. They chose the \"new name\" for themselves instead of the name their parents gave them when they were born.\nSome people have another reason for changing their names. They have moved to a new country and want to use a name that is usual there. For example, Li Kaiming changed his name to Ken Lee when he moved to the United States. He uses the name Ken at his job and at school. But with his family and Chinese friends, he uses Li Kaiming. For some people, using different names makes life easier in their new country.\nIn many countries, a woman changes her family name to her husband's after she gets married. But today, many women are keeping their own family name and not using their husband's. Sometimes, women use their own name in some situations(情况)and their husband's in other situations. And some use both their own name and their husband's.",

They do not get their first full-time work or begin college studies until they are 17 or 18 years old.\nThe high school day is about 7 hours long. Part of the day is made into classes of about 50 minutes long. The students have lunch in the middle of the day. American students study English, history, math, science, art and languages. Some also learn job skills. They can learn how to use a computer or how to mend a car. Other students may learn by working in an office, a hospital or other places one day a week.\nJean Wilton Anderson is 16 years old. She lives with her parents and 2 younger brothers in Bethesda, Maryland, near Washington D.C. Jean studies at Whitman High School. There are about 1500 students at the school. Most of them will go up to colleges.\nJean wakes up early every morning. She begins school at about 7:30. This is her third year of high school. Every day she takes classes to learn English, world history, physics and trigonometry. (三角)She also has a class about different religions(宗教). And she plays the violin in music classes. School ends at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Yet, Jean stays 2 or more hours longer every day for sports. Jean arrives home at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. She eats dinner. Then she starts her homework. She also spends a lot of time talking on the telephone with her friends. Students in America have their way of talking. They use the word \"like\" all the time. Jean and her girlfriends wear blue jeans and shirts or sweaters every day. The boys at her school also wear blue jeans. But they like to wear blue jeans that are several sizes too large for them.\nLike students of her age in most part of the country, Jean began driving a car when she was 16 years old. She does not have her car. Most of the students in high school have their own car. Many of them drive their cars to school every day.",

It is even a symbol for wildlife conservation(保存,保护). But many other species have not been as lucky as the panda. Some are already extinct. Today, many more are in serious danger. This is because man hunts them and destroys their habitat. Is it too late to save wildlife?\nA serious habitat problem arises(出现)because of pollution or opening new lands. Habitants take many years to grow again. When the wild animals lose their homes, the natural balance is also changed. If one animal, bird, or insect disappears, all the others suffer, too.\nThis is what is happening in the forests of South America. Africa and Asia. Habitats and animals are disappearing in Europe, too. Since 1947 in Britain, for example, 50% of the woods, low wet land, and 95% of meadows have disappeared. And what has taken the place of these green, natural places? Houses, farms, cities, streets, roads, and factories. Because of this (and pollution too) several British species are dying.\nThen, what is the solution? There is only one way to save wild animals and wild habitats---conservation. This means man should protect animals in danger by establishing law, opening more national parks, building fewer new roads, planting more forests, and cutting pollution. If not, many wild animals will soon have just one habitat---the zoo!",

It is opened by a local family. From the hotel you can see the whole village, the forests and the mountains. Temperatures in summer are usually 20 to 25 in the daytime, but much cooler by evening.\n\nEnjoy Thailand(泰国)!\nWhen you visit Bangkok in Thailand, don't miss the early morning river boat trip to the Floating(漂浮) just outside the city. There you will find many kinds of fruits and vegetables. And you can pay for them when you sit in your boat. Don't forget your hat: the sun can be strong and it may be as hot as 40 at noon.\n\nVisit Hawaii!\nMaybe the most beautiful place in Hawaii is Kauai. You can visit its long, sandy beaches in the south and west of the island, and mountains and forests in the north, but don't be surprised if it rains in the centre of the island. Daytime temperatures there are usually around 24 to 26 by the sea, and only a little cooler by late evening.",

When Einstein died,Doctor Harvey was called on to examine his body.It was then that he started to study what had become a long time examination of Einstein's brain.His goal was to discover some physical evidence(证据)of the scientist's genius(天才).Doctor Harvey, however,did not tell Einstein's family that he kept the great man's brain.It was only later that the family learned of Doctor Harvey's work.They did not like the idea at first. After Doctor Harvey explain his idea to them, they agreed to permit him to study the brain.Doctor Harvey then asked two other scientists to help. They cut the brain into 3pieces. They marked each piece before placing it in containers with chemical formaldehyde (甲醛) to protect it. They also prepared several extremely tiny pieces of the brain for study. Doctor Harvey has been studying Einstein's brain since then. He has carried it with him as he moved from job to job and form place to place. He has also lent parts of the brain to other scientists for study.Only one researcher has found something. A doctor at the University of California found that the left part of Einstein's brain has more cells (细胞) than normal (正常标准). Such cells are known to feed the brain.

But your computer and television may be on holiday too as power cuts hit China.This year energy shortages cover 24 provinces across the county , 8 provinces more than last year.These shortage can usually be blamed (归咎) on air conditioners. Wuhan, in Hubei, where temperatures can be 36℃, is a good example. As much as 100,000kw of electricity would be saved if people set their air conditioners one degree higher than normal.Here's how you can help to save energy.・Use air conditioners less. Set the temperature a little bit higher than normal and turn it off one hour before you go out.・Turn off the lights when you leave a room.・Unplug (拔掉插头) electricity devices (电器) when not in use. Many televisions and computers use electricity even when they are turned off.・In rooms where you don't often stay for long, close curtains during the day to keep off the sun, especially on windows that face south or west. Open them in the evening to let cool air in so you may not need to use air conditioners.・Take shorter showers. Water heaters use a lot of energy.・Open your refrigerator door only when necessary. Each time you open the door, the compressor (压缩机) will run for 8-10 minutes to keep the inside cold.・Ask your parents to replace your regular lights with fluorescent (荧光的) lights. They use about a fourth of the energy of regular lights.",

A large number of trees are being cut down to make paper. If everyone uses paper carelessly, soon there will be fewer and fewer trees. Other things are also being wasted. and people don't know what to do with the waste in big cities. So it is necessary to reduce the amount of waste we produce.\nReuse―You should always think of reusing things before throwing them away. For example, give the clothes you do not wear or the ones which are too small to the poor. In a family you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters.\nRecycle―Bottles, cans and paper can easily be recycled. By doing so, we save lots of time and money. For example, used Coke cans can be collected, sent to factory and melted(融化). The metal can be used to make new Coke cans.\nRecover―When you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten(腐烂的) ones. You have two ways to choose; one is to throw all the apples away. The second is to throw the rotten ones and keep the good ones. In this way, you are recovering the eatable ( 可吃的) parts of food.\nRepair―If one of the legs of your table is broken, you should repair it. If you want to buy something newer and better, it is better for you to sell the old one, or give it to people who can use it after repairing it.\nLearn the rules to protect our environment. Let's try our best to make the earth cleaner and more beautiful.",

The satellites take pictures of the atmosphere(大气), because this is where the weather forms(形成). They send these pictures to the weather stations. So meteorologists(气象学家)can see the weather of any part of the world. From the pictures, the scientists can often say how the weather will change.\nToday, nearly five hundred weather stations in sixty countries receive satellite pictures. When they receive new pictures, the meteorologists compare(比较)them with earlier ones. Perhaps they may find that the clouds have changed during the last few hours. This may mean that the weather on the ground may soon change, too. In their next weather forecast, the meteorologists can say this.\nSo the weather satellites are a great help to the meteorologists. Before satellites were invented, the scientists could forecast the weather for about 24 or 48 hours. Now they can make good forecasts for three or five days. Soon, perhaps, they may be able to forecast the weather for a week or more ahead(提前).",

They have a basketball game every Saturday morning. In spring and summer, Joseph plays baseball. His team has a game twice a week and practices at least once. It is easy to see that Joseph is very active after school.\nWhile most American children are in school, they have a PE class just once a week for 45 minutes. Boys and girls from kindergarten (幼儿园) to Grade 12 do not have to have a PE class in school every day. They do not have to exercise.\nNot all American children are as active in sports after school as Joseph is. So these boys and girls need to exercise in school. Many people believe that the health of American children is in trouble. 40% of children from age 5 to 8 may be unhealthy already because of little bodily activity and poor food.\nIn many countries in the world, all schoolchildren have to do one hour of exercise every day. These exercises do not have to be team sports. They may be simple (简单), such as running, jumping, or climbing. Doctors say that habits learned early are more probably to stay with us through life.

We quickly found out after we brought our three babies home.\nThe first six months was a difficult learning experience. We wrote everything down, such as what time the babies ate and how much food they ate. We marked all the toys, bottles and clothes with a different color for each child so they could know what was theirs.\nSix months to four years: It was hardest for us to find all the things. We had three of everything. Even though we tried very hard, we would never be able to carefully watch all three of them at the same time. Every two-year-old wanted to touch and taste everything, but everything had to be shared by the triplets. We soon learned that they each wanted what their sisters had at that moment.\nWhen they began to speak, my wife noticed that they had their own names for each other. When we began to record the special sounds that they said to each other, we realized that they had their own language. The age when we felt happiest was two.\nSchool age: When it was time to send the children to school, they went to three different classes. Kindergarten and first grade were easier for the kids than they were for us. They each had plenty of art homework. Since they had three different assignments (作业), homework lasted a long time. Second grade seemed to be less of a problem at homework time because they were able to do more work without our help.\nThe triplets didn\"t always get along. Sometimes they fought just like other brothers and sisters. However, there was still a bond (联系) between them that my wife and I wished never disappeared.",

In Japan, people use landmarks in their directions instead of street name. For example, the Japanese will say to travellers, \"Go straight down the corner. Turn left at the big hotel and go pass a fruit market. The post office is across from the bus stop.\"\nIn the countryside of the America, Midwest, usually there are not many landmarks. There are no mountains, so the land is very flat. In many places there are no towns or building within (在以内) miles. Instead of landmarks, people will tell you directions and distances(距离). In Kansas or Iowa, for example, people will say. \"Go north two miles. Turn east, and then go another mile.\"\nPeople in Los Angeles, California, have no idea of distance on the map: they measure(测量) distance by means of time, not miles. \"How far away is the post office?\" you ask. \"Oh,\" the answer, \"It's about five minutes from here.\" You say, \"Yes, but how many miles away is it?\" They don't know.\nPeople in Greece sometimes do not even try to give directions because visitors seldom understand the Greek language. Instead of giving you the direction, a Greek will often says, \"Follow me.\" Then he will lead you through the streets of the city to the post office.\nSometimes a person doesn't know the answer to your question. What happens in this situation? A New Yorker might say, \"Sorry I have no idea.\" But in Yucatan, Mexico, no one answers with \"I don't know.\" People in Yucatan think that \"I don't know\" is impolite.

This makes what happened last Saturday even more disappointing (失望).\nIt was my son's birthday so we booked a no-smoking table at your restaurant for 7.30pm. We arrived on time but were told that our table was not yet ready. At 8.00pm, we were given a table in the smoking section (区). I asked to move but I was told that there were no other tables. A lot of people were smoking so it was uncomfortable and unhealthy.\nOur first waitress, Janet, was very polite and helpful. She gave us free drinks for waiting so long. Our food also came quickly and looked fresh and tasty. When my wife had eaten most of her meal, she found a dead cockroach (蟑螂) in her vegetables. She was greatly surprised and wanted to leave. At first, the waitress told us it was a piece of onion. When we told her that onion does not have legs, she said sorry and took the food away.\nWe asked for the bill, hoping not to pay for my wife's meal. Nobody came. After 15 minutes, I asked to see the manager. The head waiter told us that you were on holiday. I complained again about the terrible cockroach. He told me Janet had finished work. He didn't believe my story and gave me a bill for three meals.\nThe waitress, Janet, was always friendly, but I would like your impolite head waiter to say sorry and a full refund (退款) for our meal. It cost $68. Until then, I will not be eating at your restaurant.\nYou can contact (联系) me at 742-3254 or through e-mail if you want more information:\nThank you for your attention.\nYours sincerely\nRaymond Yuen",

They began skipping (离开)P.E. to play on the school computer. Their school_struck a deal_with a computer company. It allowed Allen and Gates to use the company's computers for free if they fixed their bugs (病毒). They even started their first software business while in high school. Computers were their lives.\nAfter leaving school, Allen worked as a programmer. Gates went to Harvard University to study law (法律). The invention of computers small enough to be used in homes, called PCs, helped Allen persuade (说服) Gates to leave university and start Microsoft together. They developed software like MS-DOS and BASIC for large companies like IBM and later they came up with a new system, called Windows. Allen was one of the main programmer. Microsoft Word and Office soon followed.\nAllen fell ill in 1983. He stopped working full-time for Microsoft. He took time off, read, traveled, learned to scuba-dive and spent more time with his family.\nBill Gates is clearly the main person behind Microsoft but without Allen, he could be a lawyer, instead of the richest man in the world.",

The first one is about drinking. Now, you may not buy alcohol(酒)in this country if you are under 18 years of age, nor may your friends buy it for you. Secondly, noise. Enjoy yourselves by all means, but please don't make unnecessary noise, particularly at night. We ask you to respect other people who may wish to be quiet. Thirdly, crossing the road. Be careful. The traffic moves on the left side of the road in this country. Use pedestrian(行人)crossings and do not take any chance when crossing the road. My next point is about litter. It is an offence(违法行为)to drop litter in the street. When you have something to throw away, please put in in your pocket and take it home, or put it in a litter bin. Finally, as regards to smoking, it is against the law to buy cigarettes or tobacco if you are under 16 years of age. I'd like to finish by saying that if you require any sort of help or assistance, you should _contact _your local police station, who will be pleased to help you. Now, are there any questions?",

They are also proud of their country and its history, and they feel that the kilt is part of that history. That's why the men still wear kilts at traditional(传统的) dances and on national holidays. They believe they are wearing the same clothes that Scottish men always used to wear. That's what they believe. However, kilts are not really so old. Before 1730,Scottish men wore a long shirt and blanket(毯子) around their shoulders. These clothes got in the way when the men started to work in factories. So, in 1730 a factory owner changed the blanket into a skirt:kilt. That's how the first kilt was made. Then, in the late 1700s Scottish soldiers in the British Army began to wear kilts. One reason for this was national feelings: The Scottish soldiers wanted to be different from the English soldiers. The British Army probably had a different reason: A Scottish soldier in a kilt was always easy to find! The Scottish soldiers fought very hard and became famous. The kilt was part of the fame , and in the early 1800s men all around Scotland began to wear kilts. These kilts had colourful stripes(条纹)going up and down and across. In the 1700s and early 1800s,the colour of the stripes had no special meaning. Men sometimes owned kilts in several different colours. But later the colours became important to the Scottish families. By about 1850,most families had special colours for their kilts. For example, men from the Campell family had kilts with green, yellow, and blue stripes. Scottish people often believe that the colours of the kilts are part of their family history. In fact, each family just chose the colour they liked best. This is not the story you will hear today if you are in Scotland. Most Scottish people still believe that kilts are as old as Scotland and that the colours are as old as the Scottish families. Sometimes feeling are stronger than facts!",

So people call him the \"father\" of Dolly.\nTony: In fact, the word \"clone\" means to produce the \"same\" animal by taking cells from a grown-up one. I think, if we know how to do cloning, we need only to keep a small number of sheep, cows or horses.\nLana: What's more, these days some people even want to clone humans. They have asked: Can we clone ourselves?\nTony: It seems interesting. But do you think it possible to do that?\nLana: No, impossible! First, I think we cannot clone a dead person, because the cells in his body are dead already.\nTony: Then can we clone a living person?\nLana: Again no! You might clone yourself one after another, but it is only a copy, not a real you. It is only something, not a \"human\".\nTony: Well, you mean that it is not a real human.\nLana: True enough!

Man can only drink or use the other 3% of the fresh water (淡水) which comes from rivers, lakes and underground.\nThe sea is very big. Look at the map of the world, there is more sea than land. It covers three quarters of the earth. It looks very beautiful when the sun is shining on it. But it can be terrible when there is a strong wind.\nSome parts of the sea are very deep. There is one place near Japan. It's nearly 11 kilometres deep. The highest mountain in the world is about 9 kilometres high. If we put that mountain into the sea at that place, there would be about 2 kilometres of water above it!\nThe sea is salty. There is one \"sea\" called the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea is not a sea. It's a big lake in the Jordan valley. The Dead Sea is about 80 kilometres long, between 4.8 and 17.7 kilometres wide. In fact, the average width(平均宽度)is 13.11 kilometres. It's the saltiest. Fish can't live in it and plants can't grow near it. People can't swim well in the Dead Sea, but they can float (漂浮) on the water. The water is very blue and the air is clean. In winter people come to the Dead Sea to enjoy the sunshine.",

They could see its place in the sky. They watched the stars move as the seasons changed. But the Greeks had no tools to help themselves study the heavens.\nEach new tool coming to the field of astronomy helped man reach out into space. Until there were telescopes (望远镜) that helped man see farther to the sky, man knew a little about the moon. He did not know that the planet called Saturn (土星)had rings around it. Man could not see all the planets at that time. In the early 1700s, people thought there were only six planets. Pluto (冥王星), the last of the nine planets to be discovered, was not seen until 1930.\nBefore the spectroscopes (分光镜), man did not know what kind of gas was in the sun or other stars. Without the radio telescopes (射电望远镜), we did not know that radio noises came from far in space.\nToday, astronomy is a growing science. We have learned more in the past fifty years than in the whole history of astronomy.

Sleeping in space is not easy, either. He has to sleep in a special sleeping bag on the wall because there is no gravity. Yang can eat chicken and rice. It's especially made to eat in space but it doesn't taste nice.\n\"I'm feeling very good in space, and it looks wonderful here,\" said Yang, \"I have looked at our beautiful earth and I have recorded all that I have seen here.\"\nChina has become the third country in the world to send a person into space after the former Soviet Union(前苏联) and the United States.

Now the fish are healthy again and people can enjoy swimming in clean water.\nWhen food is brought from the grocery store to the home, it is packaged in paper, glass, tin, or plastic. Every day a newspaper comes to the home. Americans used to put all these materials in the garbage dump(垃圾堆)or landfill. The truck dumped the garbage into a large hole and then land was pushed over the garbage until the hole was filled. Then, a new hole must found.\nAs the years went by, the garbage increased as the pollution grew. Scientists suggested that some garbage could be used again. They suggested four ideas to businessmen who could make money by recycling or using paper, glass, tin, and plastic again.\nNow, a recycling truck comes to each home once a week to pick up materials. American families collect their newspapers in boxes and clean all glass, tin , and plastic, The truck takes them to a factory for recycling.\nThe newspaper is ground up into very small pieces and made into new paper again. The glass is divided into colors of green, brown, and clear mostly. The glass is crushed(捣,碾) and made into new glass. The tin is cleaned and melted so it can be made into new tin cans. The plastic is melted down so it can be used to make new containers.\nRecycling is a way to save the environment from pollution by using many materials again.",

One of the things he discovered(发现)was that Chinese used paper money. In western countries, people did not use paper money until the 15th century. However, people in China began to use paper money in the 7th century.\nA Chinese man called Cai Lun invented paper almost 2,000 years ago. He made it from wood. He made it from wood. He took the wood from trees and made it into paper. He then put these pieces of paper together and made them a book.\nNew paper still comes from trees. We use a lot of paper every day. If we keep on wasting so\nmuch paper, there will not be any trees left on the earth. If there are no trees, there will be no\npaper. Every day, people throw away about 2,800 tons(吨)of paper in our city. It takes 17 trees to\nmake one ton of paper. This means that we are cutting nearly 48,000 trees every day. Since it takes\nmore than 10 years for a tree to grow, we must start using less paper now. If we don't, we will not\nhave enough time to grow more trees to take the place of those we use for paper.\nSo how can we save paper? We can use both sides of every piece of paper, especially when\nwe are making notes. We can choose drinks in bottles instead of those in paper packets. We can\nalso use cotton handkerchiefs(手帕)and not paper ones. When we go shopping, we can use fewer\nbags. If the shop assistant does give us a paper bag, we can save it and reuse it later.\nEveryone can help to save paper. If we all think carefully, we can help protect trees. But we should do it now, before it is too late.",

Some common abbreviations are:\ninfo (information)  puter (computer)  pic (picture) sec (second)\nWe usually don't see people when we communicate on the Net, so people have new ways to show their emotions. Most people use their keyboards to draw \"emoticons\",such as:\n:-) (happy)  :-( (sad)   ;-) ( joking)  :-o (surprised)\nThese days, many forums have picture emoticons.\nThere are even whole new words, like 'newbie' (someone who is new on a chat board or forum). When you write something bad about someone else, it's called 'flaming' the person.\nIt takes time to get used to e-talk. Also, different groups in the Net have their own special ways of communicating. Newbies sometimes have to ask other people what they mean. As the Internet grows, e-talk will continue to grow and change.",

Their full title is \"The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Awards\". The Academy is a group of people who have worked in the film industry for many years. They decide who will receive the awards. The awards are often referred to as the \"Oscar\". This is a nickname given to the awards by a lady called Margaret Herrick. She was once the director of the Academy and she once said that the little gold statue reminded her of her uncle Oscar!\nThe Oscar is always an exciting event. Each year, at least one unusual thing happens. When the Italian actor and director Roberto Benigni won an Oscar for best foreign film, he danced on stage! When Gwyneth Paltrow, the star of Shakespeare in Love won the Oscar for best actress, she could not make her acceptance speech because she was crying so much with happiness!\nIn 1987, Roberto Benigni won the award for best director for a film about the last emperor of China. Since then, Chinese film and actors have started to make an impact at the award. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a huge success and it won the award for best foreign language film in 2001. It also won several technical awards for its amazing \"flying\" people. We expect to see more awards for Chinese film in the near future.\nIt's time for the Oscar again. Once more, the stars will dress up in their finest and go to Kodar Theater. There, they will find out who had won the awards for best actor, best actress and best director. Millions of people watch the awards every year to find out who the winners are. Some people watch it to see the stars crying and laughing as they receive their awards.",

But how do you find real friendship and keep it?\n\"The Care and Keeping of Friends\" by American author Sally Seamans tells young students some smart ways to find friends.\nSally says finding friendship is just like planting a tree. You plant the seed and take care of it to make it grow.\nFirst, you should choose a friend. What makes a good friends? It is not because a person has money or good looks. A good friend should be kind and patient. For example, if you have a bad day, a good friend should listen to your complaints(抱怨) and do their best to help. To make a friend, you cannot be too shy. You should make each other happy and share your lives.\nBut things cannot always be happy. Even the best friends have fights. What should you do when you have a fight with your friend? You have to talk to them. When there is no one around, have an honest talk. If he or she doesn't want to talk, you could write a letter.\nSally says there are three steps to being friends again: Tell him or her how you are feeling; say what your friend has done wrong, and explain why you did this or that. The book also has advice on some small but important things like celebrating your friends' success.  Even if you haven't had a real friend before, you will start to think of having one if you read this book. Because the book tells that friendship is the most important thing in your life.",

They do not eat with their hands because, as they say, people do not always have clean hands. \"\nBefore leaving for England, Thomas Coryate bought a few forks.\nAt home Thomas had a dinner party to show the invention to his friends. When the steak (牛排)was brought out, he took out a fork and began to eat as they did in Italy.\nEverybody looked at him in surprise. When he told his friends what the fork was, they all wanted to take a good look at the strange thing. All his friends said that the Italians were very strange people because the fork was not easy to use at all.\nThomas Coryate tried to prove (证明)that his friends were wrong. He said it was not nice to eat meat with one\"s fingers because they were not always clean.\nEverybody got angry at that. Did Mr Coryate think that people in England always had dirty hands? And weren\"t the ten fingers we had enough for us?\nThomas Coryate wanted to show that it was very easy to use the fork. But the first piece of meat he took with the fork fell to the floor. His friends began to laugh and he had to take the fork away.\nPeople in England began to use forks only fifty years later.",

It is very dirty. It is not good for people to breathe this dirty air.\nTo keep pollution down, the States tests cars every two years. This test checks to make sure the cars do not pollute the air. If a car does not pass the test, the owner cannot drive it the next year.\nSome car owners drive their cars even though they cannot pass the test. It is also very bad for the air.\nPeople want to find a way to get these cars off the road. So a state program was started that now seems to be helping. In this program the States buys cars that cannot pass the tests or will help pay for repairs. This program has been helping people buy better cars or fix their old ones. It has also been helping to cut down on pollution.\nTo meet the needs for the program, a car must be drivable and the owner must meet certain income (收入)restrictions (限制). In order to get help from the program, a motorist must have a family income of no more than 185% of the national poverty guidelines (贫困线). For a family of four, that would be no more than $32, 653 each year.\nThe state program that takes polluting cars off the road has just finished its first year, and people say it has been successful.\nFor the past year, the state program has been buying cars that can\"t pass the tests. Some car owners get as much as $1,000 for their old ones, while others receive as much as $500 for repairs.\nThe cars bought by the States through the program are put out of use and sent to dismantlers (拆卸厂).",

Some of them \"migrate. \"This means that they travel to other places where the weather is warmer or where they can find food.\nMany birds migrate in autumn. Because the trip can be dangerous, some travel in large groups. For example, geese (鹅)fly in noisy, \"V\"-shaped groups. Other kinds of birds fly alone.\nSome animals stay active in winter. They must change themselves as weather changes. Many change their doing or their bodies. For example, Snowshoe rabbits (兔子)grow white fur (毛)to help them hide in the snow.\nFood is hard to find in winter. Some animals, like mice (老鼠), collect lots of food in autumn and store it to eat later. Some animals eat different kinds of food as the seasons change. The red fox eats fruit and insects (昆虫)in spring, summer and autumn. In winter, it can not find these things, so instead it eats small animals.\nSome animals \"hibernate\"for part or all of the winter. This is a special, very deep sleep. The animal\"s body temperature drops, and its heartbeat and breathing slow down. It uses very little energy (能量). In autumn, these animals get ready for winter by eating much more food than in summer and storing it as body fat. They use this fat to keep them alive while hibernating. Some also store food like nuts to eat later in winter. Bears and some bats (蝙蝠)hibernate.\nCold-blooded (冷血的)animals like fish, frogs(青蛙)and snakes have no way to keep warm during the winter. Snakes find protection in holes, and spend the winter without moving during the whole season.\nWater makes good protection for many animals. When the weather gets cold, they move to the bottom (底部)of lakes and rivers. There, frogs and many fish hide under rocks or fallen leaves. Cold water holds more oxygen (氧气)than warm water, and frogs can breathe through their skin.\nEvery type of insect has its own life cycle (循环), which is the way it grows and changes. Different insects spend the winter in different forms of their lives. Many insects also spend the winter without moving. Their growth and development stop. The insect\"s heartbeat, breathing and temperature drop. Some insects spend the winter as pupae (蛹). (This is a time when insects change from one form to another. )Other insects die after laying eggs in autumn. The eggs change into new insects in spring and everything begins all over again.",

There is an old saying. \"Friends are God's way of taking care of us.\" But how do you find real friendship and keep it?\nThe American writer Sally Seamans tells young students some smart ways to find friends. Sally says finding friendship is just like planting a tree. You plant the seed(种子)and take care of it to make it grow.\nFirst, you should choose a friend. What makes a good friend? It is not because a person has money or good looks. A good friend should be kind and patient(耐心的). For example, if you have a bad day, a good friend should listen to your complaints and do his or her best to help. To make a friend, you cannot be too shy. You should make each other happy and share your lives.\nBut things cannot always be happy. Even the best friends have fights. What should you do when you have a fight with your friend? You have to talk to him or her. When there is no one around, have an honest talk. If he or she doesn't want to talk, you could write a letter.\nThere are three steps to being friends again:\nTell him or her how you are feeling; say what your friend has done wrong, and explain why you did this or that. Remember that friendship is the most important thing in your life.",

They found that people who exercised while listening to Italian musician Antonio Vivaldi's \"The Four Seasons\" did much better on language ability tests than without music.\n\"Facts suggest that exercise improve the learning ability of people with heart disease,\" said the psychologist Charles Emery, who led the study. \"And listening to music is thought to_enhance_understanding. We just wanted to put the two results together,\" he added.\nThe volunteers said they felt better emotionally and physically after working out with or without the music. But their improvement on the test doubled after listening to music during exercise. Scientists have proved that music can be good for health, education and well-being. It helps reduce stress, sadness and nervousness; encourages relaxation or sleep; wakes up the body and improves memory and thoughts.\nIn medical fields, music is used widely for patients who have had head hurts before and after operation. \"The Four Seasons\" was used because of its moderate tempo(舒缓的节拍)and positive results in earlier research.\" Exercise seems to cause positive changes in the nervous system(神经系统)and these changes may have a direct result on learning ability,\" Emery said.\nScientists have been studying the results of music on understanding since the early 1950s. By 1990, psychologists were using Mozart's music, especially his violin pieces, to help children with speech disorders. Mozart was chosen because his music is not over-exciting and has clear structures. A study showed students who listened to Mozart went on to score higher marks in an intelligence test. With important exams drawing near, your parents will not probably allow you to listen to music. But perhaps now you have good reasons to argue with them.",

My American friends want me to join them in their dinner party. I am very happy and have decided to go, but I'm a little worried about it, too. The social customs in my country are very different from here, so I'm afraid of making mistakes.\nShould I bring a present, such as sweets or flowers? Should I arrive on time or a little late? At the dinner table, how can I know which fork (叉子) or knife to use? How can I let the family know that I'm thankful for their kindness?\nWang Lin\n\nLetter B\nDear Wang Lin,\nIt's a good idea to bring a small present when you go to a dinner party. Flowers are always nice, or you may bring a bottle of wine (葡萄酒) if you know that your friends drink it.\nYou should arrive on time or five to ten minutes late. Don't get there early. If you're going to be more than fifteen minutes late, you should call and tell them.\nTry to be free at the dinner table. If you don't know about choosing the right fork or knife, just watch the other people, and follow them. If you still have no idea of what to do, ask the person next to you.\nIf you like the food, say so. Of course, you'll thank them for the meal and for their kindness. It's also a good idea to send a thank-you card the day after.\nRose",

It takes time to get to know a person and it takes time to find someone with whom you really get on.\nThe first thing you must do is smile at your classmates. One smile speaks louder about your wish to make friends than any words. Do this as often as you can, until your classmates become used to your smiles and smile in return.\nThe next thing to do is try to talk to your classmates. The best time to do this is between classes or during your lunch time. Make sure that they are not busy. You may find it easier to start by talking to people when they are alone, instead of in a group.\nThere must be someone else in your class who is so quiet. It might be easier to try and talk to someone who is as shy as you.\nYour problem is mainly about confidence. Smile first, talk next and slowly you will make friends. Once you have more confidence, you can make as many friends as you want.\nUncle Jeff",

But what the boy said surprised Paul greatly.\"I wish,\" the boy went on, \"that I could be a brother like that.\" Paul looked at the boy in surprise, then he said again, \"Would you like to take a ride in my car?\"\"Oh yes, I'd love that.\"After a short ride, the boy turned and with his eyes shining, said, \"Paul, would you mind driving in front of my house?\"Paul smiled a little. He thought he knew what the boy wanted. He wanted to show his neighbours that he could ride home in a big car. But Paul was wrong again. \"Will you stop where those two steps are?\" the boy asked.He ran up to the steps. Then in a short while Paul heard him coming back, but he was not coming fast. He was carrying his little crippled brother. He sat him down on the step and pointed to the car.\"There she is, Buddy, just like I told you upstairs. His brother gave it to him for Christmas and it didn't cost him a cent. And some day I'm going to give you one just like it …then you can see for yourself all the nice things in the Christmas window that I've been trying to tell you about.\"Paul got out and lifted the boy to the front seat of his car. The shining-eyed older brother climbed in beside him and the three of them began an unforgettable holiday ride.注:urchin顽童, hesitate犹豫, neighbour邻居, crippled残疾,cent 美分",

They beat(打) the air with their wings(翅膀) and climb up through the air. The air keeps them up.\nMan knew how to make kites hundreds of years ago. Kites could stay in the air for many hours. \" If birds and kites can stay up in the air, perhaps we can,\" they thought.\nAt first they made wings like birds. Then they jumped off high buildings and tried ot fly. Many men did this but they failed to fly. Can you guess which way? They tried balloons(气球). \"Hot air is lighter than cold air,\" they said. \"That is why hot air goes upwards. If we fill a balloon with hot air, it will go upwards.\"\nIt was time for man to fly. In October 1783 another of the brothers' balloons went up. This time a man went with it. The balloon did not rise very far. It went only to twenty-five metres. It was tied to the ground by a rope(绳子). A month later two men went up in a balloon full of hot air. This time there was no rope. A great group of people watched. The balloon rose to height(高)of 900 metres. Then it came slowly back to earth. Men had traveled through the air for the first time.\nLater, airships were made and they were filled with a gas(气体) called hydrogen. But the hydrogen gas was dangerous. It caught fire very easily. At last they stopped making airships.",

Instead, take a nap.\nThere are many benefits (好处) of a daily nap. First of all, you are more efficient (有效率) after napping. You remember things better and make fewer mistakes. Also, you can learn things more easily after taking a nap. A 20-minute nap can reduce information overload. It can also reduce stress. Finally, a nap may increase your self-confidence and make you more alert (灵活). It may even cheer you up.\nBut, there are some simple rules you should follow about taking a nap. First, take a nap in the middle of the day, about eight hours after you wake up. Otherwise, you may disturb your sleep-wake pattern. Next, a 20-minute nap is best. If you sleep longer, you may fall into a deep sleep. After waking from a deep sleep, you will feel worse. Also, you should set an alarm clock. That way, you can fully relax during your nap. You won't have to keep looking at the clock so that you don't oversleep.\nNow, the next time you feel sleepy after lunch, don't get stressed.

They think animals' behavior (行为) can be connected to future weather conditions or events. For example, if swans fly into the wind, a hurricane is coming. Or, if cows lie down, a rainstorm is coming. There are many traditional stories connecting animals and natural events. Many people think that these stories are just folklore, traditional stories and beliefs without scientific evidence. Scientists, however, are beginning to take another look at some of these ideas.\nKiyoshi Shimamura is a Japanese earthquake researcher. He noticed an increase in dog bites a short time before earthquakes hit. Then, he did an investigation (调查) of twelve public health centers in Kobe, Japan. These health centers treated people after the 1995 earthquake. He noticed some interesting information about the month before the big earthquake. Treatment for animal bites had increased. In fact, aggressive (冒犯的;侵略的) behavior in dogs, such as biting and barking loudly, jumped (猛增) 60 percent!\nPeople noticed other changes in animal behavior before the earthquake as well. For example, fish began swimming together in large groups, only in the middle of the water and not near the edges. Also, birds flew away from their nests for many days, leaving their eggs unprotected. The animal behavior suggests that animals may be able to predict natural events better than people.",

The best students won't only have high marks. They will also be kids who don't dye(染)their hair, smoke or drink. The following are some of the new rules.\nTell the truth. Have you ever copied someone else' s work on an exam? Don't do it again! That's not something an honest student should do. If you have played com­puter games for two hours in your room, don't tell your parents you have done homework.\nDo more at school. Good students love animals and care for other people. April is Bird-Loving Month in China. Is your school doing anything to celebrate? You should join! That way, you can learn more about animals and how to protect them. When more people work to­gether, it makes it more fun for everyone.\nHave you ever quarreled with your teammates when your basketball team lost? Only working together can make your team stronger. Be friendly to the people you are with. Try to think of others, not only yourself.\nBe open to new ideas. Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon? May­be you'll discover Earth II someday. Don't look down on new ideas. Everyone's ideas are important. You should welcome them, because new ideas make life better for everyone.\nProtect yourself. Has someone ever taken money from one of your classmates? Don't let it happen to you. If you have to go home late, you should let your parents know.\nUse the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for your studies. But some things on the Internet aren't for kids, so try to look at Web pages that are good for you. You can use the Web for fun or homework. Can' t you find any good Web sites for children? Here are some:\nhttp://www. eastday. com\nhttp://www.chinakids. net. com\nhttp://www. cycnet. Com",

Now is the answer.\nIn the modern times, the middle part of a cinema film has lots of small photographs, each one of which is different from the one before it. Each photograph is brought in front of a strong light, and there it stops for a very small part of a second. This photograph, therefore, appear on the screen, and we see it. Then the light is covered and next photograph is move to the position in front the strong light. Meanwhile(同时), the metal cover turns away from the light. Thus, the second photograph is shown on the screen. This is done again and again, twenty-four times a second, and we think we are watching a moving picture on the screen. But noting on the screen actually moves. \"The moving picture\" is in fact made of a lot of bits. We see about 86,400 different pictures every hour, but none of them moves.\nThe voices, noises and the music are recorded on the side of the cinema film. The record looks marks of strange shapes. The side of the film passes in front of another light, and the rays(射线) of light which pass through change as the marks change. These marks have been made from the voices and other sounds of the people and events in front of the cinema when the film is being made. The marks may be considered(认为,考虑) as \"printed sound\".",

But if we read correctly the signs around us, we can tell what the more important changes in the weather will be. This way of telling what the weather will be like on the following day or two is called weather forecasting. For many centuries and in all countries, people have studied the weather and tried to make weather forecasting. Rings around the sun are a sign of coming rain. Many people feel their joints hurt in their bones if wet weather is coming. Some birds fly high if fine weather is coming, but they fly near the ground if rainy or stormy weather is on the way. It is probably because of the insects (昆虫) which they are hunting that they fly low. If you see a rainbow (彩虹) during rainy weather, this is a sign that the weather will become clear and fine. Such rainbows come in the evening. If the stars twinkle clearly at night, then fine weather will continue. If a fog appears in the morning just above a river, then the day will be warm. If the sunset is mostly red in color, then the following day will be fine. If a rainbow appears in the morning, rainy weather will probably come. Most of the above sayings have been made by the people who have used their eyes and brains to make weather forecasting.",

In the opening match, Senegal surprised everyone by beating France, the World Cup winner in 1998. Japan then beat Russia, the USA beat Portugal, and South Korea beat Italy, Spain, Poland, and Portugal. South Korea made it all the way to the final four, before finally losing to Germany.\nIn the final game, which was watched by one billion people around the world, Brazil won 2-0 over Germany.

He placed medical tools and a small video camera in her stomach area(腹部). Doctor Marescaux in New York watched the patient on a video screen Then he used the computer to send messages to the robot machine.\nThe robot moved the tools that cut the woman's gall bladder (胆囊) away. The woman got well soon after the operation and left the hospital two days later.\nExperts say the main problem with such a robotic operation is based on high - speed telecom­munications (通讯系统) between the doctor and the robot. Technology must be able to send a doctor's order to a robot to move the tool quickly.\nExperts also say a successful robotic operation will improve an operation. For example, the robot can make much smaller movements(动作) than a person can. A robot machine can turn tools in ways that a doctor's hand cannot.\nDoctors say such a robotic operation will make possible safer and better operations in the future. They say it will improve doctor training. It will also mean that doctors could do an opera­tion on people in dangerous places far away. And it could mean that people could have operations done by top doctors without having to travel to the city where the doctors work.",

Now children in the United States have heavy schoolbags.\nDoctors are starting to worry that younger and younger students are having back and neck problems as a result of schoolbags being too heavy for them.\n\"It's hard for me to go upstairs with my bag because it's so heavy,\" said Rick Hammond, an 11-year-old student in the U.S.\nRick is among students who have common schoolbags with two straps(带子)to carry them, but many students choose rolling(有滚轮的)bags.\nBut even with rolling bags, getting upstairs and buses is still a problem for children. Many of them hurt their backs and necks because of the heavy schoolbags.\nBut how much is too much? Doctors say students should carry no more than 10% to 15% of their own body weight(重量).\nScott Bautch, a back doctor, said children under Grade 4 should stay with 10%. But it is also important that older children don't stay with over 15%, because their bodies are still growing. \"Children are losing their balance and falling down with their schoolbags,\" he said.\nParents and teachers are starting to tell children to only take home the books they will be reading that night. Some teachers are using pieces of paper or thin workbooks for students to take home.\nOne of the best answers is, as some children said, to have no homework at all!",

It is a common idea that children today know about computers and have a good knowledge(知识)of using them in all sides of their lives.\nWe decided to try to find out whether this was true.\nWe asked thirty young people between 14 and 18. All the children said they had computers at home. We asked them how much time they usually spent on their computers in a week, but we were most interested in what they used their computers for.\nThe average(平均的)time spent on a computer in a week was 12 hours, with the highest user about 30 hours and the lowest user only 5 hours. There were no differences between boys and girls.\nAll the children said they usually used their computers to play games. Fourteen told us they did some word-processing(文字处理)at home, but not very much. Only three of them said that computers helped them with their studies, and nine people told us that they kept addresses and telephone numbers on their computers, or used them as diaries. Only four people said that they were learning to make programmes, and nobody looked up date-bases(数据库)(other than their address list). None of the people used their computers for any other use. The diagram(图表)below gives all the results one by one.\nThe results show that computer use is quite high among 14-18 years old children. They also show quite clearly that computers are used by most young people as_little more than_game machines. The only other great uses are for word-processing and keeping address lists. It seems to us that, though computers are common in the homes of young people, they have not yet become useful in everyday life.",

Sometimes he was sent away to a home for children who had no parents.\nBut twenty years later, this same Chaplin became the greatest, best-known, and best-loved comedian (喜剧演员) in the world. Any regular visitor to the cinema, must have seen some of Charlie Chaplin's films. People everywhere have sat and laughed at them until the tears ran down their faces. Even people who don't understand English can enjoy his films, because they are mostly silent. It isn't what he says that makes us laugh. His comedy doesn't depend upon (依靠) words or language. It depends upon little actions which mean the thing to people all over the word. Acting out without words, of common human situations plays an important part in the dances and plays in many countries. It's a kind of the world language.\nChaplin lived most of his life in America and died in Switzerland on Christmas Day 1977, at the age of eighty-eight. There was sadness all over the world at the news of his death.",

Do not bent over, from your waist (腰) keep your back and hips (臀部) and waist in a line. If you bent over, the muscles in your lower back can became hurt very easily. If you keep your back and hips straight, the muscles are stronger, because they hold up together. The other muscles can then help the lower back muscles.\nAs you lower yourself, try to get as close to thing as you can, put one knee on each side of the thing. Remember at all times to keep your back straight. Put your hand under the thing that is in front of you, between y our knees.\nTo lift the thing, you should stand up slowly. Use your leg muscles in order to stand up. In other words, lift with your legs, not with your back.",

Many years ago, the problem was not so serious because there were not so many people. When the land was used up or the river was dirty in a place, men moved to another place. But this is no longer true. Man is now slowly polluting the whole world.\nAir pollution is still the most serious. It's bad for all living things in the world, but it is not only one kind of pollution. Water pollution kills our fish and pollutes our drinking water. Noise pollution makes us become angry more easily.\nMany countries are making rules to fight pollution. They stop the people from burning coal(煤) in houses and factories in the city, and from blowing dirty smoke into the air.\nThe pollution of SO2is now the most dangerous problem of air pollution. It is caused(引起)by heavy traffic. It is certain that if there fewer people driving, there will be less air pollution. The earth is our home. We must take care of it.

It wasn't really a diner. It was only a simple (简单的)food cart(大车). People on the street walked up to the cart to buy food. These carts sold meal. The meal was a sandwich or eggs. In 1887, Samuel Messer Jones built the first diner big enough to allow people to come inside. However, they did not sit down. Later, people built diners with tables and chairs, and people sat down while they ate. Before long, many diners stayed open around the clock. Diners changed in other ways, too. The old menu (菜单)became bigger. Diners soon became permanent (永久性的)buildings.\nModern diners look similar to the diners of the early 1900s. They are buildings with large windows. People can eat all three meals in them. Today, many people eat in fast-food restaurants such as McDonald's and Burger King. However, the diner keeps an American tradition (传统), and thousands of people still enjoy eating there.",

His doctor tried to help him, but there was no cure (治疗方法)for rabies at that time. The doctor told Joseph's parents that perhaps there was one man who could save Joseph's life. His name was Louis Pasteur.\nWhen Pasteur was a young boy in France, he was very interested in medicine, so he spent many hours every day with the chemist who lived in his small town. The chemist sold all kinds of medicine. At that time, the chemist had to make all the medicine himself. Young Louis enjoyed watching the chemist as he worked and listening to him help people who came to him each day. Pasteur decided that one day he wanted to help people, too.\nAs a schoolboy, Pasteur worked slowly and carefully. At first, his teachers thought that young Louis might be a slow learner. Through elementary school, high school and college, Pasteur worked the same thoughtful way. In fact, he was not a slow learner, but a very clever young man. He became a college professor and a scientist, and he continued to work very carefully.\nBecause of Pasteur's patient ways, he was able to make many observations (观察)about germs (细菌). For example, germs make meat and milk bad. They also cause (引起)many serious diseases. Pasteur was studying about the germs that caused rabies when Joseph Meister became ill. In fact, Pasteur believed he had a cure for rabies, but he had never given it to a person before. At first, Pasteur was afraid to treat (治疗)Joseph, but his doctor said the child was dying. Pasteur gave Joseph an inoculation (免疫注射)every day for ten days. Slowly, the child became better.",

She put the doll on top of the other toys. \"Oh,dear,\"I said. \"You don't have to give Lucy. You love her so much.\".Meghan said,\"Lucy makes me happy,Mommy. Maybe she'll make another little girl happy,too.\"\nI looked at Meghan for a long moment. She taught me a lesson.

From morning to night there were tourists outside the house.They kept looking into the rooms through the windows and many of them even went into Mr. David's garden. This was too much for Mr. David. He decided to drive the visitors away. So he put a notice on the window. The notice said: \"If you want to satisfy your curiosity (好奇心), come in and look around. Price (价格): twenty dollars.\" Mr. David was sure that the visitors would stop coming, but he was wrong. More and more visitors came and Mr. David had to spend every day showing them around his house. \"I came here to retire, not to work as a guide (导游).\" he said angrily.

You leave these boxes on wheels and go to very large tall boxes. After resting all day you get back in your little boxes and return to your big boxes. There you sit and look at very small glowing boxes with moving pictures on the front.\nThere is only one thing I don't understand. I went to a football game one day.

One day the computer broke down. People had to do the computer's work. They soon found out what was happening.\nAnother thief who worked for a bank saw people filling indeposit forms(存款单). Many of these people did not know their account numbers, so they wrote only their names on the forms. They left the place empty for their account numbers. The thief wrote his own account numbers in the place. When the computer read these forms it looked only at the account numbers. It did not look at the customers' names. It paid the money on these deposit forms into the thief's account.\nThen there was a bank worker who told the bank computer to take ten cents off every customer's account each month and put it into his own account. For a long time the bank's customers did not notice that they were losing ten cents every months. But then someone did notice and told the bank. That was the end of that little game!\nNo one really knows how much computer crime is costing the banks, but some people believe it is millions of dollars a year.",

Some of the reports about them are difficult to believe, some have been explained in scientific ways, and others have never been explained.\nIt's not easy to decide whether a report is true or not. One report of UFOs came from a British plane on its way from New York to London in 1954. The British plane was flying over an island at 19,000 feet when the captain noticed that something was on their left and a little lower than their plane. It's about five miles away.\n\"It was not one object but several,\" the captain said. \"We saw one large and six smaller objects. I sent out a radio to report about them and I received the answer that the other planes were coming out to meet us. Before the planes arrived, the smaller objects entered the big object. The big object then became smaller and moved away fast.\"",

It is a team of twelve girls and nine boys, from eleven different provinces. The youngest is only thirteen years old. Most of them can't hear any sound and shoud meet a lot of trouble.Sign language teachers saw it clearly how hard the actors had worked. Chen Jiahui,a sign language teacher said,\"Our actors often rehearse(排练)14 hours every day .It is very hard work even to healthy people.\"The only way to the success lies in hard work and steadfast(坚定的) characters. Every day, they got up at half past six.they began to rehearse from 8:30am until 12:00 am.At 1:00pm, they went on to rehearse until 6:00pm. After7:00pm,they started to learn computer,art,and so on. Although the work was hard, everyone did help each other. So they felt that they were members of a big family. Every time, in order to put each hand in the right place, the sign language teacher would record how the actors practiced. There was a big screen in the front. When they practiced, it would be shown to them. Though they couldn't hear, they could see. Everyone knew which hand was his or her own. They also made sure whether they were in the right place or not. They practiced again and again. Chen Jiahui said,\"The boys'hand are harder than girls'. They press their hands every day. Many boys'hands have swelled(肿).The doctor advices them to rest, but they still practice without any word.I am really moved by them. Now, Buddha With A Thousand Hands performed around the word. Many foreigners are also moved. In France, an audience said,\"It is the best program that I have seen. I forget everything when I saw their performance. I really thank them for their wonderful performance.\" We haven't been moved for a long time.As a healthy student , what do we learn form them?",

Without \"cool\", some people have no words to show the same meaning. So it is quite important to keep some credibility(可信性).

Their deep network of roots joins the soil together and stops it from dying out, making it possible for living things to live in it.\nHuman beings are like the living things in the forest. We need one another in order to live. We need the farmers to grow our food, railroad and truck drivers to bring it to our shops and clerks(售票员) to sell it to us. We need people to prepare our food and cook it and others to take our waste things away. Then, of course, we need doctors, nurses, government leaders, mailmen, telephone operators, and many others.\nWe also need other human beings in another way. We need people for friendship, to talk over our problems, exchange ideas. Think how lonely and unhappy you would be if you lived all alone.\nLife is a matter of giving and taking.

He may also say, \"Oh, no. I want to take you to lunch at Smith's,\" or \"I want you to try the Chinese dumplings there. They're great.\" This means the person wants to pay for both of you. If you feel friendly towards this person, you can go with him and you needn't pay for the meal. You may just say, \"Thank you.\" That would be very nice.\nAmerican customs(风俗)about who pays for dates(约会)are much the same as in other parts of the world. In the old days, American women wanted men to pay for all the meals. But, today, a university girl or a woman in business world will usually pay her way during the day.

Jeans are very popular all over the world.\nJeans give you the feeling of comfort, youth(青春)and energy(精力). They have long been liked by every person.\nLevi Strauss is an American company. It first made blue jeans. The company was founded in 1853 by 24-year-old Levi Strauss. Twenty years later, he made the first blue jeans in the world. The jeans were used as working trousers for the cowboys(牛仔)of the American West. During the Second World War, American soldiers brought blue jeans to Europe(欧洲)and Asia(亚洲).People there began to wear jeans. Little by little, they become cool.\nPeople from different countries like different styles of jeans. Americans like to wear simple(简单的)and single-colored jeans, but many Chinese like to wear jeans with lots of different colors.\nJeans now can be seen everywhere. However, in many places, it's not always good to wear jeans. No matter how good they may look, or what color they are, it's often not right to wear jeans in formal(正式的)places. But, when you are out, relaxing and having fun, jeans are the best choice.",

Most students sleep less than nine hours every night, because they have much homework to do. Some homework is given by their teachers, and some by their parents. Also, some students don't know how to save time. They are not careful enough while they do their homework, so it takes them a lot of time. Some students spend too much time watching TV or playing computer games. They stay up very late. Some students have to get up early every morning on weekdays to get to school in time by bus or by bike. It can be a long way from home to school.Schools and parents should cut down some of the homework so that our children can enjoy more than nine hours of sleep every night for their health. For children, we should make best use of our time. When we have enough time for sleeping, we will find it much better for both our study and health.",

So it was how Marco Polo's journey began. During three years of traveling to the Far East, he saw sights that were almost unbelievable to a boy from Italy. He met people who had strange ways of living. Some spoke languages that he did not even understand. At last they reached China. This was in the year 1275. The emperor made a great feast in honor of the Polos and asked Marco to live in his court(朝廷,庭院). Marco Polo learned to read, write and speak new languages.\nOnce the emperor sent him to distant western and southern part of his empire. Marco Polo was given many soldiers and servants for his journey.\nMarco saw paper made by the Chinese. People in China had also discovered how to print on paper; they had many books and even used paper money! They burned little black rocks for heat.\nAfter three years, he wrote a book about his travels, which most people in Europe did not believe. But many years later the world knew that this man discovered a great Eastern country.",

The problem is that the people in Jean's family are so busy that they can hardly find time to be with her. In fact, Jean is quite lonely.\nSo Jean spends a lot of her time on . She likes being anonymous, talking to people who do not know about her famous family and her rich life. She uses the name Linda on  and has made a lot of friends who she contacts quite often.\nLast year Jean made a very special friend on . His name was David and he lived in San Francisco. David was full of stories and jokes. He and Jean had a common interest in rock music and modern dance. So it always took them hours to talk happily on  and sometimes they even forgot the time. Of course, they wanted to know more about each other. David sent a picture of himself: he was a tall, good-looking young man with a big, happy smile. As time went by, they became good friends and often sent cards and small things to each other.\nWhen Jean's father told her that he was going on a business trip to San Francisco, she asked him to let her go with him, so that she could give David a surprise for his birthday. She would take him the latest DVD of their favourite rock singer. But when Jean knocked on David's door in San Francisco, she found that the special friend she had written to was a twelve-year-old boy named Jim.",

Her Barbi bike was just too old, and it needed repairing as well.\nAs Christmas came nearer, her dream for a bike seemed to disappear, so we thought, for she didn't mention it again. We were busy buying some beautiful storybooks, a doll house, a holiday dress and toys. Then much to our surprise, on December 24, she said she really wanted a bike more than anything else.\nNow we didn't know what to do. It was just too late. We were busy with Christmas dinner and packing children's presents, parents' presents, a brother's present and friends' presents till midnight. So there was no time to take to buy the \"right bike\" for our little girl. Thinking that we were parents who would make their child unhappy, we felt guilty and sad.\nSuddenly my husband came up with an idea. \"What if I make a little bike out of clay (泥土) and write a note (便条) that she could trade in (交换) the model bike for a real one?\" So he spent the next five hours carefully working with clay to make a small bike.\nOn Christmas morning, we were so excited for Almie Rose to open the little box with the beautiful red and white clay bike and the note. She opened and read the note loudly.\nShe looked at me and Ron and said, \"So does this mean I can trade in this bike for a real one?\" Smiling, I said, \"Yes.\"\nAlmie Rose had tears in her eyes when she replied, \"I would never trade in this beautiful bike that Daddy made me. I prefer to keep it rather than get a real bike.\" At that moment, we would have moved (感动) the God to buy her every bike on the Earth.",

There are so many colorful peacocks(孔雀) here.\nThe peacocks mostly live on the grass land of Dongfeng Square. They are given food freely by visitors. They usually throw food to them, and don't think about at all whether the food is right or not. Some of the peacocks became ill, some even died after eating the bad food given by the visitors.\nI'm sure most of the visitors who throw food to the peacocks really like the birds, but don't realize that they may be doing them harm.\nThe visitors should be told that what they have done is very harmful to the birds, and this kind of thing must be stopped from happening.\nPerhaps we can build some small shops beside Dongfeng Square to sell peacock food. For us every person, it is our duty to give more love to these beautiful birds and to look after them carefully.\nYours,\nSun Yan",

And he made it.\nBob thought his problem was over after he had been one of the dancers in the dancing group. But a bigger problem was just beginning. The school didn't allow Bob to stay in the girls' group. \"If we let Bob stay in the group,\" the school said, \"other boys will want to join. Soon, there won't be any girls in the group.\" They took Bob off the group.\nBob was very angry about it, so he went to a judge (法官).

They used the cocoa bean (可可豆) to make a chocolate drink and they enjoyed it very much. Many years later, the cocoa bean was brought to other countries and people came to love the taste of chocolate.\nIn 1824, John Cadbury opened a small shop in Britain. One of the things he sold was chocolate drink. In 1831, he opened a factory to make chocolate drink. He wanted to encourage people to drink chocolate instead of other drinks. A few years later, a man called Joseph Fry found a way to make chocolate bars (条状巧克力), and so for the first time people had the chance to eat chocolate instead of only drinking it. But at that time chocolate was very expensive and only the rich people could buy it. Later, as more and more chocolate bars were produced and sold, it became cheaper.\nHowever, at first only plain chocolate (a kind of chocolate without mile and with very little sugar) was produced. Milk chocolate cam later and this was made by adding milk to the chocolate. The first milk chocolate bar was made in Cadbury's factory in 1897. Their most famous chocolate, Cadbury's Milk Bar, was made in 1905. It has been the most popular chocolate in Britain and around the world for over 100 years. Cadbury's factory is still in Britain and the chocolate produced there is eaten all over the world. Every year, thousands of visitors visit the factory in order to see how chocolate is made.",

We are changing the earth, the air and the water, and everything that grows and lives here. We can't live without these things. If it continues like this, we shall destroy ourselves. What will happen in the future? Perhaps it is more important to ask \"What must we do now?\" The people who will be living in the world of tomorrow are the young of today. A lot of them know that conservation is necessary. Many are helping to save our world. They plant trees, build bridges across rivers in forests, and so on. In a small town in the United States a large group of girls cleaned the banks of 11 kilometers of their river. Young people may hear about conservation through a record called NO ONE'S GOING TO CHANGE OUR WORLD. It was made by the Beatles and other singers.

Some believe the air inside many houses may be more dangerous than the air outside.\nMost scientists agree that every modern house has some kinds of indoor pollution. People began to notice the problem in the early 1970s. When builders began making houses and offices, they did not want to waste energy. To do this they used man-made building materials which are now known to let out harmful gases(毒气).\nAs the problem became more serious, scientists began to search for a way to deal with it. They discovered a natural pollution control system(控制体系)for building―green plants.\nScientists believe that a plant's leaves absorb the pollutants. And it lets out oxygen(氧气) through its leaves. Studies of different plants show that each absorbs different chemicals(化学物). So the best way to clean the air is to use different kinds of plants.",

He landed safely at 6:23 am the next day, making China the third country to successfully(成功地)send a person into space, after the former Soviet Union(前苏联)and US.\nYang was pleased with his job. \"I have seen many landing scenes before on video, and I think ours was one of the most successful, \" he said on a special plane to Beijing after landing.\nBorn into an ordinary family in Liaoning Province, he became a pilot (飞行员)in the Chinese Air Force in 1987, spending 1,350 hours in the air. He joined the Chinese space programme 11 years later. While in space, Yang recorded everything he saw as well as showing China\"s national flag and the United Nations\" flag to the people watching on TV at home. He also ate a meal of diced chicken and fried rice, before taking a 3-hour nap(a short sleep ). The whole programme went according to(按照)plan, but space exploration is not as easy as it seems.\nAnyone who saw the destruction (breaking ) of the US space shuttle(航天飞机) Columbia in February this year will know that Yang took a great risk (danger) .\nHe experienced(经历)very high temperature, while the gravitational forces(重力) on takeoff and landing were strong enough to force tears from his eyes.He has spent five years training to become a spaceman.\"I eat all of my meals at the space programme\"s dinning room and have never been able to take my son to school, \" he said. \"I've never met his teachers.\"\nBut all the hard work was well worth it -- Yang has become China\"s first spaceman.",

Then in the early 1800's the world started to change. There was little unknown land left in the world. People didn't have to explore(探测) much any more. They began to work instead to make life better.In the second half of the 19th century many great inventions were made. Among them were the camera, the light and the radio. These all became a big part of our life today.The first part of the 20th century saw more great inventions. The helicopter in 1909. Movies with sound in 1926. The computer in 1928. And jet planes in 1930. This was also a time when a new material was first made. Nylon came in 1935. It changed the kind of clothes people wear.By this time most people had a very good life, Man has a_ desire _to explore again, The world was known to man but the stars were not. Man began looking for ways to go into space. Russia made the first step. Then the United States took a step. Since then other countries, including China and Japan , have made their steps into space.In 1969 man took his biggest step from the earth. Americans first walked on the moon. This is certainly just a beginning thought. New inventions will some day allow us to do things we have never yet dreamed of.",

Coffee is so popular, but do you know the story of coffee and how it was discovered? There is an old story that says coffee was discovered in Africa long, long ago.\nOne day, a farmer was watching his goats, and he saw them eat some smalll berries(干种子) from a plant. After they ate the berries, the goats became very active. The man often felt tired, so he decided to try the berries too. Surprisingly, he did not feel tired any more. Coffee plants were thus discovered. The coffee was taken from Africa to Arabia(阿拉伯岛), and there it was first used as medicine. The Arabs kept coffee a secret for many years. Later, coffee came to Turkey(土耳其), then Italy, then France. From Europe, the coffee plant was taken to America. People found that coffee plants grew well in many parts of South America, so large coffee farms were started , and many coffee plants were grown. On these farms, coffee beans were picked from the plants by hand. Then the beans were dried and prepared for market to sell. Different coffee beans were mixed (混合)together to produce different kinds of coffee. Coffee was sent to all over the world, and soon became very popular.",

There are some answers to these questions in an unusual place: the island of Okinawa in Japan.\nMatsuko Suzuki, a Japanese scientist, is a well-known professor on old age. Dr Suzuki has been studying why Okinawa has more than double the Japanese average of_centenarians_. He has studied 521 centenarians from Okinawa. He says that if people eat a mainly vegetarian food, they may live much longer. He also says that if one's parents or grandparents live longer than average, their children will live longer, too.\nThese centenarians on Okinawa are all very active. For example, they enjoy walking and they're interested in gardening. They will help out with farming work if they feel they can. They always do things in the way they feel most comfortable. People elsewhere often laugh about \"Okinawa time.\" Dr Suzuki says that if people work harder than they can, they will get sick more easily.\nDr Suzuki reports that old people do very well if they are gently respected尊重 and clearly loved. Family life and church services are very important. Dr Suzuki believes he will find more reasons for living a long life if he goes on with his study.",

For example, a person who earns about ＄3,500 a year, will pay a tax of only about 3.5% of earning, but if the same person earned ＄85,000 a year, he would pay an income tax of 35%. Over years the incomes tax has become more and more difficult for people to understand. Almost one half of all Americans now have to pay experts to prepare their tax reports.

They also listen to the news about sports, the weather, and the life of American people. Most of the radio programmers are music. Pop or popular music singers make much money. They make a CD or tape which radio stations use in many places. Once the popular singer is heard all over the country, young people buy his or her tape. Some of the money from these tapes goes to the singer. Wherever the singer goes, all the young people want to meet him or her. Now the singer has become a national star. There are other kinds of music that are important to Americans. One is called folk(民间) music. It tells stories about the common life of Americans. Another is called western or country music. This was started by cowboys(牛仔) who would sing at night to the cows they were watching.

I'm good at it. I'm very glad to tell you something about how I study English.\nFirst, I think an interest(爱好)in English is very important. When I was in Grade One, we had a new subject �C English. It was fresh for me. I was interested in it, so I worked hard at it. Soon we had an English exam and I got a very good mark. How happy I was! After that, I learned English harder and harder. Our English teacher often teaches us English songs, the songs sound nice. I often think how interesting English is!\nSecond, I think English is a foreign language. I should learn it well in the following ways: Listen to the teacher carefully, speak bravely, read aloud and have a good vocabulary(词汇). Then practice again and again, never be tired. And I also have a good habit: Asking whenever(不论何时)I have a question, I must make it clear by asking our English teacher. How happy I am when I understand!\nBesides this, I often read English stories, jokes and easy novels. From these I know English is not only interesting, but also useful. They help me understand a lot of things. So to do more reading is an important way to learn English well.\nAnd I also do some exercises from our class magazines, and I often write English diaries. English has become a close friend of mine.\nNow I have learned English for more than two years. I always keep the first position in our school. From these words, I hope every student can learn English well.",

I'm afraid you'll never learn to swim just by reading books about swimming or looking at others swimming. It's the same with the English study. We must practice, practice and practice.\nListening and speaking are very important for beginners. The children in English-speaking countries first listen to others. Then they try to imitate and speak. We can listen to English programs on radio. You may just understand a few words. It doesn't matter. Just be relaxed, try to catch every word.\nSomebody may be a good listener. But he dare not speak. He's afraid of making mistakes. You know we sometimes make mistakes when we speak Chinese. Don't be afraid. We must be brave. If you really want to learn English well, you must try to speak with everyone so long as he knows English. Whether you know him or not is not important when there's nobody to talk with, you can talk to yourself in English. It's interesting and also a good way to practice your spoken English. Remember, the more you speak, the fewer mistakes you'll make.\nReading and writing are more important for senior school students. First we must choose the books we're interested in. A lot of reading will improve your language sense. This is the most important.\nKeep writing English diaries. We can also write English articles. You may even post them to English magazines. Don't be afraid of failure. Failure is the mother of success.\nEasier said than done. Well, let's do more practice from now on. I'm sure you'll learn English well in this way.",

Their brain(大脑)is as big as men's and they live a long life-at least 20 or 30 years.\nLike some animals, dolphins use sounds to help them find their way around. They also use these sounds to talk to each other and to help them find food. They do not use their ears to receive sounds, but use the jaw-the lower part of the mouth.\nIt si strange that dolphins are friendly to men, and for thousands of years, there are many stories about dolphins and men. In the 19 th century, in a dangerous part of the sea near New Zealand, there was a dolphin, the seaman liked him very much and gave him a very good name, Jack. From 1871 to 1903 a passenger on a boat with the name of The Penguin shot and hurt Jack. Luckily the dolphin didn't die, and after a long time he was well again. He guided the ships through the area for nine more year, but he refused to help the boat The Penguin.\nToday, some people still kill dolphins, but many countries in the world now protect them. In these places, people are not allowed to kill them.",

The Greeks weren't the only people interested in how the body worked. Old drawings and texts from China and the Middle East also showed human organs. Some even showed plant organs.\nAt first, information about organs came from operations and from cutting up dead bodies. Now we can look at X-rays and body scans, too.\nIn the late 1700s, a French doctor called Xavier Bichat did hundreds of post-mortems. Post-mortems are operations carried out on dead bodies, to find out what killed them. Bichat found that each human organ contains more than one kind of material. He listed 21 different kinds. Today, we call these materials tissues(组织). Bichat wasn't able to see the detailed structure of these tissues, because he didn't have a microscope.",

They also listen to the news about sports,the weather,and the life of American people. Most of the radio programmers are music.Pop or popular music singers make much money. They make a CD or tape which radio stations use in many places. Once the popular singer is heard all over the country,young people buy his or her tape.

Now the singer ahs become a national star.There are other kinds of music that are important to Americans. One is called folk(民间) music. It tells stories about the common life of Americans. Another is called western or country music. This was started by cowboys(牛仔) who would sing at night to the cows they were watching.

            "context": "Without goals, life is meaningless. Goals provide the direction in life. It is always wondered why some people cannot see the importance of goals, the need to set goals and follow them through. Very few people would get on a plane or a ship, not knowing where they were traveling to. Goals are the aim for striving (奋斗目标) and those who walk about without plans through life waste a great deal of time.\nGoal setting has long been thought to be necessary in business and more recently many people have come to think highly of some of the great people in the world - people who set simple goals and who go after them - such as Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa and Michael Jordan.\nFor personal development, the starting point is setting goals. Sometimes the starting point is dreaming, having wishes, then breaking their big plan into small ones that can be achieved (实现). A useful idea is to think about what you would really like to achieve, what you will be in the future - five years from now, ten years from now. Writing these down is a good starting point.\nIt is always wise to break goals up into short-term and long-term goals. Knowing that something is achievable soon can give more confidence to achieve._Long-term goals will probably be fewer , but short-term goals can fall into a \"more possible to achieve\" basket ._\nGoals need to be started with clearness. The clearer they are, the easier they are to reach. If a goal is shown clearly, it can guide to a fitting action. It is important that a person never loses sight of their goals. To do so is to become aimless and off track. It is sometimes useful to question yourself. \"How important is this goal to me?\" If the answer is \"I think it is very important \", then it must be followed. That means that action must be taken at once.\nDelay (拖延) is the thief (贼) of time for human. The longer you delay, the more difficult it is to achieve goals. There are many people who probably have less skill (技能), even less education than you, yet they succeed. It is most likely because they take action, they realized (认识到) what they want, what they set out to do. They achieve their goal. Goal setting really never finishes for the successful person. Once a goal has been achieved, there is another to be set and reached for.",

Then the driver turned and very slowly began to drive his car into the space. Just as he was doing this, a very young man in a Mini came up from behind. He noticed the space and drove straight in, nose first. The older driver in the Rolls Royce stopped his car suddenly. He was very angry and red in the face. He wound down his window and looked at the young man. But the young man wasn't sorry. He had got out of his car now and he was laughing. \"You have to be young to do that!\" he said to the old driver and pointed at his Mini very hard. There wasn't much room of the Mini left when the older driver had finished. The young man watched what was happening and couldn't believe his eyes. He was very angry and red in the face. The older driver looked out of the window and smiled. \" You have to be rich to do that,\", he said.",

Some people think if children do something wrong, they should be punished (惩罚). Others do not agree. The Inuits or Eskimos in Alaska almost never punish their children. The parents do not beat them. If the children go too far, their parents will punish them by making fun of them. Children in other parts of the world are not as lucky as Eskimo children. American parents can beat their children at home, but a teacher can't beat a child at school. This is also true in Germany. Instead, in Sweden it is against the law for anyone to beat a child. Swedish parents can't beat their children. The children also have a government official (官员) who works for their fights (权力).

They kill some animals to eat, but they do not destroy them.\nWhen we cut down the rainforests, we destroy these forest people, too. In 1900, there were 1,000,000 forest people in the Amazon forest. In 1980 there were only 200,000.\nThe Yanomami live along the rivers of the rainforest in the north of Brazil (巴西). They have lived in the rainforest for about 10,000 years and they use more than 2,000 different plants for food and for medicine. But in 1988, someone found gold. They cut down the forest to make roads. They made more than a hundred airports. The Yanomami people lost land and food. Many died because new diseases came to the forest with the strangers.\nThe Yanomomi people tried to save their forest, because it was their home. But the people who wanted gold were stronger.\nMany forest people try to save their forests. Chico Medes was famous in Brazil because he wanted to keep the forest for his people ,\"I want the Amazon forest to help all of us-forest people, Brazil, and all the earth.\"he said. A few months later, in December 1988, people who wanted to cut down the forest killed Chico Medes.\nIn Borneo, people were cutting down the forest of the Penan people to sell the wood. The Penan people tried to save their rainforest. They made blockades (障碍) across the roads into the forest. In 1987, they closed fifteen roads for eight months. No one cut down any trees during that time.\nIn Panama, the Kuna people saved their forest. They made a forest park which tourists pay to visit.\nThe Cavioes people of Brazil use the forest, but they protect it as well. They find and sell Brazil nuts (坚果) which grow on the forest trees.",

The weather was bad and the students had to stay indoors. As they could not take part in their usual outdoor sports, they ere unhappy, and some of them even get into fights from time to time. Finally, some of the teachers at the college asked Dr. J. E. Naismith to invent a game so that the students might have something to play at. It was not easy to invent such (这种的) a game because it had to be played indoors, and the court was not very large.Dr. Naismith thought for a few days and invented a kind of ball game. It was a fast, exciting game with much moving and passing of the ball. It was played between two teams. In order to make a score, the ball had to be thrown into a basket ten feet above the floor on the wall. At each end of the court there was such a basket. At first, Dr. Naismith had planned to have the ball thrown into a box. As he couldn't find boxes ofthe right size, he had to use fruit baskets instead. That is how the game gotits name---basketball.",

You don't need to care about those people who have beautiful houses with large gardens and swimming pools or those who have nice cars and a lot of money and so on. Why? Because those who have big houses may often feel lonely and those who have cars may want to walk on the country roads at their free time.\nIn fact, happiness is always around you if you put your heart into it. When you are in trouble at school, your friends will help you; when you study hard at your lessons, your parents are always taking good care of your life and your health; when you get success(成功), your friends will say congratulations to you; when you do something wrong, people around you will help you to correct it. And when you do something good to others, you will feel happy too. All these are your happiness. If you notice a bit of them, you can see that happiness is always around you.\nHappiness is not the same as money. It is a feeling of your heart. When you are poor, you can also say you are very happy, because you have something else that can't be bought with money. When you meet with difficulties, you can say loudly you are very happy, because you have more chances to challenge(挑战) yourself. So you cannot always say you are poor and you have bad luck. As the saying goes, life is like a revolving(旋转的) door. When it closes, it also opens. If you take every chance you get, you can be a happy and lucky person.",

Soon you can enjoy the round, moon-shaped food with different fillings (馅) such as red beans or nuts.\nFamily members get together to enjoy the bright moonlight. But, do you know, Koreans(韩国人) also have a day known as the Mid-Autumn Festival? It's called \"Chusok\", and falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar (阴历的) month of their calendar.\nAs one of the most important holidays in Korea, they have three days off work! Chusok is a time to give thanks to family for their love and care. This is very similar to America's Thanksgiving Day!\nAt Chusok, people also eat the delicious food served at the family get-together. They eat rice cakes named \"Songphyun\"(蒸糕) instead of mooncakes!\nEarly in the morning, they pay respect to ancestors (祖宗) with rituals (仪式) and thank them for their good luck.\nDo they enjoy the moon together like us in China? The answer is yes. In the evening, girls put on their favourite traditional (传统的) clothing and dance in the moonlight in a large circle. The dance is normally done wearing a mask (面具). It's also a time for games and songs. Everyone has fun!",

You may have a favourite food, but you'd better eat something different, if you eat different foods, you will probably get more nutrients (营养物质) your body needs.\nSecond, drink water and milk as often as possible. When you're really thirsty, cold water is the No.l choice (选择). Milk is a great drink that can give you more calcium (钙) your body needs to grow strong bones (骨头).\nThird, listen to your body. How do you feel when you are full? When you are eating, notice how your body feels and when your stomach (胃) feels comfortably full. Eating too much will not make you feel comfortable and make you fat.\nFourth, limit (限制) screen time. Screen time is the time you watch TV, DVDs and videos, or using computers. It is good to take more exercise such as basketball, bike riding and swimming. You can't watch TV for more than two hours a day.\nFifth, be active. One thing you'd like to do as a kid is to find out which activity you like best. Find ways to be active every day.\nFollow these rules and you can be a healthy kid.",

One clever schoolboy has worked out that if every schoolbook in the U.S.A. was recycled, there would be enough paper for fifty packets of peanuts(花生) for every child in the world for five years.\nSeveral firms are experimenting to make containers(集装箱) from a hard plastic which, when the containers are finished, can be used as building materials.

People are cutting down millions of trees to make paper; if everyone uses paper carelessly and throws it out, soon we should not have any trees left. We are also wasting other things and don't know what to do with the waste in big cities, so it is necessary to reduce the waste.\n2.Reuse\nYou should always think of reusing the things before throwing them away. Give your used clothes or small ones to the poor. Within a family, you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters.\n3.Recycle\nWe can recycle bottles, cans and paper easily. By doing this we save lots of time and money. For example, We can send waste coke cans to a factory. Workers smash them flat and melt them, and then the metal things are made for new coke cans.\n4.Recover\nWhen you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten apples, you have two choices: one is to throw the whole apples away, or you should cut off the rotten parts and use the good parts. In this way, you are recovering the eatable parts of food.\n5.Repair\nIf one of the legs of your table is broken, you can repair it instead of throwing the table away. If you want to change for better ones, it is better for you to sell the old things or give them to other people who can use them after doing some repair. It is true that North America is a \"throw-away\" society, but the time has come to change our way of life so that we can protect our environment. Everyone should try our best.",

They do not have to pass any examinations before they are accepted(接受) as students. This is why the university is called \"open\". The university was started in order to help a known group �C people who missed having a university education when they were young.\nThe first name for the Open University was \"The University of the Air.\" The idea was to teach on the air, in other words, on the radio and television. Most of the teaching is done like this. Radio and television have brought the classroom into people's homes. But this, on its own, is not enough for a university education. The Open University student also receives advice(建议) at one of the 283 study centers in the country. Thirty-six weeks of the year he has to send written work to a \"tutor,\" the person who guides his studies. He must also spend 3 weeks every summer as a full-time student. Tutors and students meet and study together,as in other universities. At the end of the Open University's first year, the results were good. Three out of every four students passed their examinations. If they do this every year, they will finish their studies in 4 or 5 years.",

From the hotel you can see the whole village, the forests and the mountains. Temperatures in summer are usually 20 to 25 in the daytime, but much cooler by evening.\n\nEnjoy Thailand(泰国)!\nWhen you visit Bangkok in Thailand, don't miss the early morning river boat trip to the Floating(漂浮) just outside the city. There you will find many kinds of fruits and vegetables. And you can pay for them when you sit in your boat. Don't forget your hat: the sun can be strong and it may be as hot as 40 at noon.\n\nVisit Hawaii!\nMaybe the most beautiful place in Hawaii is Kauai. You can visit its long, sandy beaches in the south and west of the island, and mountains and forests in the north, but don't be surprised if it rains in the centre of the island. Daytime temperatures there are usually around 24 to 26 by the sea, and only a little cooler by late evening.",

When Einstein died,Doctor Harvey was called on to examine his body.It was then that he started to study what had become a long time examination of Einstein's brain.His goal was to discover some physical evidence(证据)of the scientist's genius(天才).Doctor Harvey, however,did not tell Einstein's family that he kept the great man's brain.It was only later that the family learned of Doctor Harvey's work.They did not like the idea at first. After Doctor Harvey explain his idea to them, they agreed to permit him to study the brain.Doctor Harvey then asked two other scientists to help. They cut the brain into 3pieces. They marked each piece before placing it in containers with chemical formaldehyde (甲醛) to protect it. They also prepared several extremely tiny pieces of the brain for study. Doctor Harvey has been studying Einstein's brain since then. He has carried it with him as he moved from job to job and form place to place. He has also lent parts of the brain to other scientists for study.Only one researcher has found something. A doctor at the University of California found that the left part of Einstein's brain has more cells (细胞) than normal (正常标准). Such cells are known to feed the brain. She said this may mean that the cells could affect (影响) intelligence (智力). Doctor Harvey says he does not think Einstein would mind the research. After all Einstein was scientist.",

But your computer and television may be on holiday too as power cuts hit China.This year energy shortages cover 24 provinces across the county , 8 provinces more than last year.These shortage can usually be blamed (归咎) on air conditioners. Wuhan, in Hubei, where temperatures can be 36℃, is a good example. As much as 100,000kw of electricity would be saved if people set their air conditioners one degree higher than normal.Here's how you can help to save energy.・Use air conditioners less. Set the temperature a little bit higher than normal and turn it off one hour before you go out.・Turn off the lights when you leave a room.・Unplug (拔掉插头) electricity devices (电器) when not in use. Many televisions and computers use electricity even when they are turned off.・In rooms where you don't often stay for long, close curtains during the day to keep off the sun, especially on windows that face south or west. Open them in the evening to let cool air in so you may not need to use air conditioners.・Take shorter showers. Water heaters use a lot of energy.・Open your refrigerator door only when necessary. Each time you open the door, the compressor (压缩机) will run for 8-10 minutes to keep the inside cold.・Ask your parents to replace your regular lights with fluorescent (荧光的) lights. They use about a fourth of the energy of regular lights.",

After graduating from university in 1963, Miyazaki joined the Toei Animation (动画片制作) Company. At Toei, he worked on many animated movies, like the famousPuss in Boots. In 1984, he madeNausicaa of the Valley of Wind, which was based on a comic book he wrote. Because this movie was so successful, Miyazaki was able to start his own animation company, Studio Ghibli.\nOne of Miyazaki's most loved movies isMy Neighbour Totoro, made in 1987. It is a children's movie, but many teenagers and adults like it too. The movie is about two sisters who become friends with a big, supernatural (神奇的) animal named Totoro. It is a very warm-hearted story, with many strange and interesting characters such as Cat Bus, a cat which is also a bus. Miyazaki's 2001 movie,Spirited Away, was even more popular than My Neighbour Totoro.\nAll of Miyazaki's movies have strange but charming people and creatures. Many of his stories happen in worlds that are different from ours. However, they still show his ideas about real life. He often points out how humans hurt the natural world. He thinks people should change the ways how they live. This may be why so many people like his movies.",

They have wind speeds of 60 kph or more. They can be very destructive (毁灭性的). In the United States, the Tropical Prediction Centre in Miami, Florida, looks out for hurricanes. When scientists discover a true hurricane, they give it a name. They can use either a man's or woman's name. Why should hurricanes have names? The names make it easier for people to keep up with information about a hurricane and its dangers.\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO), an international weather group, decides what names will be used. The WMO makes six lists (列表) of names, using the English alphabet. Each list is used for one year. When a hurricane happens, it gets the next name on the list for that year. For example, the first hurricane of the year might have the name Abel, while the second one could be Betty. The name lists do not include (包含) names beginning with the letters O, U, X, Y, and Z, since there are few names that begin with these letters. Asian countries use a different list. This list has a few personal names, but most of the names are of flowers, animals and trees.",

The standards may be changed - no examination is perfect - but to have no external( 外部的 )tests or examinations would mean the end of equality and of standards. There are groups of people who oppose this view and who do not believe either in external examinations or in any controls in schools or on teachers. This would mean that everything would depend on luck since every pupil would depend on the efficiency(实力),the ideal and the purpose of each teacher.\nWithout external examinations, employers will look for employees from the highly respected schools and from families known to them - a form of favoritism will replace equality. At the moment, the bright child from an ill - respected school can show certificates(证书)to prove he or she is suitable for a job, while the lack of a certificate shows the unsuitability of a dull child attending a well - respected school. This defense of excellence and opportunity would disappear if external examinations were taken away, and the bright child from a poor family would be a prisoner of his or her school's fame(名誉),unable to compete for employment with the child from the favored school.\nThe opponents(对手)of the examination system suggest that examinations are an evil force because they show differences between pupils. According to these people, there must be no special, different, academic class. They have even suggested that there should be no form of difference in sport or any other area: all jobs or posts should be filled by unsystematic selection. The selection would be made by people who themselves are probably selected by some computer.\nThese people are not just against school organization, but are at war with the whole idea of modem competitive society and they are using children in schools for their destructive(破坏性的)purposes.

You may hear something like this \"On last Monday evening, at about twenty minutes to ten, a cyclist was knocked down by a truck at crossing of Oak Road and High Street in Croydon. The cyclist has died from his injuries. Anyone who saw the accident please communicate(联系)with New Scotland Yard, telephone number Whitehall one, two, one, two.\"\nAccidents are often caused(引起)by carelessness. If everybody obeys the rules, the roads will be much safer. How can we make the road safer?\nIn Great Britain traffic keeps on to the left. Motor-cars, trucks, buses and cyclists must all keep to the left side of the road. In most other country traffic keeps to the right.\nBefore crossing the road, stop and look both ways. Look right, look left again. Then, if you are sure that the road is clear, that there is nothing coming, it is safe to cross the road. If you see small children, or very old people, or blind people, waiting to cross the road, it is kind act to help them to cross the road in safety.\nWe must teach young children to cross the road safely.

            "context": "Shopping habits in the United States have changed greatly in the last quarter of the twentieth century．Early in the 1900s, most American towns and cities had a Main Street．Main Street was always in the heart of a town．This street was lined on both sides with many businesses．Here, shoppers walked into stores to look at au kinds of merchandise(商品): clothing, furniture, hardware(五金), groceries(杂货)．In addition, some shops offered services．These shops included drugstores(药店), restaurants, shoe―repair stores, and barber or hairdressing shops(理发店)．But in the 1950s, a change began to take place．Too many cars and trucks had crowded into Main Street．There were few parking places．Because the streets were crowded, merchants(商人) began to look with interest at the open spaces outside the city limits．Open space is what their car―driving customers needed. And open space is what they got when the first shopping center was built．Shopping centers, or malls, started as a collection of small new stores built away from crowded city centers．Attracted by hundreds of free parking spaces, customers were drawn away from downtown areas to the outlying malls．\nBy the late 1970s, many shopping malls had almost developed into small cities themselves．In addition to providing the Convenience of one―stop shopping, malls were changed into landscaped parks, with beautiful flowers, fountains, and outdoor entertainment．For example, one of the shopping malls is The Galleria in Houston, Texas．Inside the Galleria, more than tens of shops face balconies and there is an indoor ice skating rink(溜冰场)．Some of Houston's best restaurants are also here．Atop(在……顶上)the whole mammoth(巨大的) structure is a new hotel．The Galleria, and other imaginative shopping centers throughout the United States, have led a magazine to title its recent leading article \"The Mailing of America\"",

Here is an interesting experiment that can make something disappear, when one eye is open.\nMake a card about the size of a postcard and write two English letters L and R on it, L on the left and R on the right. First, hold the card about 80cm away and you see both the letters. Then close your right eye and look at the letter R only with your left eye. And now, as you moved the card slowly towards you, you'll find the letter L disappearing. But if you move the card nearer to your face, the letter will be seen again. Now do the same experiment with your left eye closed, you'll find the letter R disappearing.\nWhy does the letter disappear? It is because there is a blind spot on the eyes. When the image (影像) of the letter falls on the blind spot, it won't be seen. That is why either of the letters disappears.",

He had about 3000 students.\nFor more than 2000 years, Conficius' ideas have been around in people's everyday lives. Now they have gone far into east and south Asia. People can still hear them today.\nWhy are his ideas so popular? They help not only in everyday life but also in society.\nConfucius' most important ideas are kindness and good manners.\nConfucius said young people should take care of the old. People should give up thinking of themselves and work for others.\nAs a great teacher, Confucius said all should go to school if they could and wanted to learn.\nSome of Confucius' popular words are: \"A kind person should care for others\" and \"be strict with yourself, but be kind to others\".\nPeople use his ideas to help themselves and society.\nNow, more than 100 Internet websites are teaching people about him.\n\"Kindness and honesty are the best values of the world today,\" said 79-year-old Kong Fanjin.

It will probably remain one as long as there are animals that give milk.\nThe old word \"milk\" came from Sanskrit (梵文), one of the oldest languages known to man. A very old picture of milking animals has been found. It was drawn five thousand years ago. People got their milk from their own animals. But in modem times new inventions made the milk industry (工业) a big business. In 1851 Gall Borden found a way to take some of the water from milk. This made it keep longer. Four years later, Louis Pasteur introduced a way to kill the bacteria (细菌) in milk. So in the same year a special milk bottle was made. This was followed by the invention of machines that could fill bottles with milk.\nThese discoveries meant that milk could be stored longer.\nSome people believe that milk drinking will become less popular than it has been. But remember how long milk has been an important food and think of the many ways in which it is useful. It seems safe to say that milk industry will always be important.",

These thoughts have caused trouble in the mother's mind.\nOne weekend the girl came to tell her mother that she was going to the cinema with her schoolmate and would return late. This was the first time her mother agreed, and she couldn't help worrying because her daughter had never been away at night before. The mother waited till nine and her uneasiness got the upper hand over her. She decided to go out to meet her daughter. Just at that moment the noise of a car pulling up drew her to the window and ――there was her daughter, waving goodbye to a boy. Her heart missed a beat. When the girl came in, the mother was watching TV, pretending nothing had happened. \"Mum, I'm back.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Sorry to be late. Still sitting up?\" \"Yes. Oh, that …. Who's that boy?\" The daughter was stunned for a moment. \"Ah. It's my monitor. He gave me a lift on his way home. Mum, I'm going to bed.\" \"All right. Go to sleep early.\"\nThe next morning when the mother went to the daughter's room to do some tidying, she found her diary left at her pillow. After a few minutes' hesitation she finally opened it to the entry of the night before. It read: Mum, it's love that made you ask, but it would show your understanding of me if you hadn't.\nHolding the diary, the mother fell into thought.",

It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that, and why you did not do this or that. Sour music, indeed, but it has to be faced.\nThe phrase \"to face the music\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from?\nThe first information comes from the American writer James Fenimore Cooper. He said ――in 1851 ――that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their cue to go on, they often said, \"It's time to go to face the music.\" And that is exactly what they did――face the orchestra(交响乐团) which was just below the stage.\nAn actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly, especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out.\nSo, \"to face the music\" came to mean having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice.\nThe other explanation comes from the army. Men had to face inspection(检阅) by their leader. The soldiers worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment(装备) clean――shiny enough to pass inspection? Still, the men had to go out, and face the music of the band, as well as the inspection. What else could they do?",

Umberto Eco, an Italian writer, thinks it is something quite different. He says the most important invention might be right in front of your eyes. He is talking about a simple pair of glasses. Modern eye glasses were invented around 1000 years ago. They were more than just a conventient way to read. Before glasses, writers, scientists or teachers who could not see properly had to memorize everything. After about ten years of poor eyesight, they could not remember well enough and could not work. Glasses meant that people could work into their old age. People who wanted to remember some information could write it down and read it. Eye glasses are one of the world's greatest inventions and were probably worn by the people who designed the first telephones and cars.",

After school Bill walked past the shop on the street corner. he stopped to look at the front row of shoes, and he felt sorry for himself. He really wanted to have a pair for his birthday.\nHe sadly walked away and thought of what to tell his mother. He knew she would give him anything if she could. But he also knew very well she had little money. He decided not to go home at once, as he looked worried and he didn't want to make his mother worry about it.

From morning to night there were tourists outside the house. They kept looking into the rooms through the windows and many of them even went into Mr. David's garden. This was too much for Mr. David.

More and more visitors came and Mr. David had to spend every day showing them around his house. \"I came here to retire, not to work as a guide.\" he said angrily.

He attached(系)fruit baskets overhead on the walls at opposite ends of the gymnasium(体育馆), and, using a soccer ball, organized(组织)nine―man teams to play his new game. In this new game the purpose(目的)was to toss (投)the ball into one basket and try to keep the opposting team from tossing the ball into the other basket. Although there have been many changes in the rules(such as the reduction of the number of players on a team from nine to five), the game is basically(基本地)the same today. The United States soldiers took it to the Philippines in 1900 and to Europe during World War I, and, being adopted(被采用)by foreign countries it soon became a world―wide sport. It is interesting that although basketball was made as an indoor game, in other countries it is now played almost entirely(完全地)outdoors.",

He became an Olympic \"dark horse\" last Thursday by winning the gold medal in men's freestyle aerial skiing(自由式滑雪空中技巧) at Turin in Italy. He made two almost perfect jumps for the highest score. Han had never won a world gold medal before, let alone(更不用说) in the Olympics!\n\"I never thought this would happen,\" said the 23-year-old. \"I feel like I'm in a dream.\" It's China's second gold medal at the Turin Olympics. But more important, Han's gold was the country's first ever in a snow sport. In 2002, China's Yang Yang won the gold for speed skating at the winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, US.\nJust because Han's win was unexpected doesn't mean that he didn't work hard.\nHan grew up in Jiangsu Province. Before he started his training on snow, he used to be an acrobat(杂技演员) at a circus. In 1995, a coach found his talent(才能). The coach, Yang Er'qi, said Han had the agility(灵活性) and courage to be a ski jumper. When Yang first took the 12-year-old to northern China, the boy couldn't swim, skate or ski. But he wasn't afraid of the high platform(跳台) and kept on training.\nHan almost left the sport after hurting his knee months before the Salt Lake Games. In that Olympics he only got 24th. \"I was hopeless at that time, but my family and the coach stood firmly(坚强地) behind me, helping me through,\" he recalled.\nHan Xiaopeng worked so hard that he won the gold medal in the Olympics at last. Because of his success, more and more people in China are becoming interested in skiing. We are proud of him and we hope he will have another big success in the next winter Olympics.",

Be sure the water gets all the way down to the roots (the parts that grow down into the soil) of the plants, but don't water too much . You could drown your plants!\nYou may see some plants in your garden that you didn't put there. These are weeds(杂草).\nPull them out when the ground is soft and wet. Be sure you get out the roots, or the weeds will grow back.\nTall plants such as tomatoes need sticks to hold them up. Without sticks ,they'll fall over.\nWhen your tomato plants get to be about two feet tall, it's time to stick to them. Push a long stick into the ground next to each plant. Tie the plant to the stick with string. As each plant grows taller, you'll have to tie it up again.\nIf you've planted seeds(种子), you can expect too many plants to come out.You have to clear some away, so that the plants left will have room to grow. This is called_thinning_.\nIf you've planted lettuce(莴苣)seeds, wait until the baby plants are about 1.5 inches tall.Then pull some of the plants out so that you leave about 8 inches between plants.\nNow that you've done all the work to make a vegetable garden, it's time to enjoy what you've finished. Pick a red, ripe , juicy tomato. Eat it while it's still warm from the sun. Or cut it up and put it in a salad(沙拉)―made with lettuce you picked yourself, If you have more vegetables from your garden than you and your family can eat, give them to friends and neighbors. It's fun to have the joy you get from your garden together with others.",

So at the least sign of hot sun, a snail_draws_its body into its shell and closes the opening with a thin cover. Then it goes to sleep. A snail will die in a heavy rain. So whenever it rains, it goes inside its shell house―and goes to sleep. A snail can sleep for as long as it needs to. It can take a short sleep. Or it can sleep for days at a time. And it spends all the winter months in its shell, asleep.\nIn the spring the snail wakes up. Its body, about three inches(时) long, comes out from the shell. When hungry, the snail looks for food. it can't see very well. its eyes, at the ends of the top feelers(触角), are very weak. But its sense(感觉) of smell is very strong. It helps the snail to the new greens. Then the snail's little mouth goes to work.\nA snail's mouth is no bigger than the point of a pin(大头针). Yet it has 25,6000 teeth! The teeth are so small that you can't see them. But they do their work. If you put a snail in a hard paper box, it will eat its way out! And if a snail wears out its teeth, it will grow new ones.\nMostly, a snail looks for food at night. But on cloudy days it eats in the daytime. It eats all day long. A snail can go on eating for hours and never feel full.",

He plays for Guangdong Tigers Club team. He played in the Chinese Basketball Association-the CBA(中国篮球协会) last season and was the group's new player of the year. Yi could be a key player at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\" It's my dream to play in the Olympics,\" Yi said. \"It would be a great honour to play in the Olympics for the country, I hope I will get a chance.\"\nYi was 12 when he first picked up a basketball. At first his parents were against his playing basketball in a sports school. But they were changed by the fact that Yi has everything for a good player such as speed and size. Yi's basketball life almost ended before it began. When he first went to training, he almost gave up halfway through.\n\"I wanted to give up,\" Yi said. \"I had never lived away from home before.\" But he decided to make the best of a difficult situation(处境).\nHis goal is to join Yao in the NBA. \" We all look up to him, and I hope I can one day in the NBA, too,\" said Yi. \"I need to learn and practice and stay cool before fame(名声).\"",

Be sure the water gets all the way down to the roots (the parts that grow down into the soil) of the plants, but don't water too much . You could drown your plants!\nYou may see some plants in your garden that you didn't put there. These are weeds(杂草).\nPull them out when the ground is soft and wet. Be sure you get out the roots, or the weeds will grow back.\nTall plants such as tomatoes need sticks to hold them up. Without sticks ,they'll fall over.\nWhen your tomato plants get to be about two feet tall, it's time to stick to them. Push a long stick into the ground next to each plant. Tie the plant to the stick with string. As each plant grows taller, you'll have to tie it up again.\nIf you've planted seeds(种子), you can expect too many plants to come out.You have to clear some away, so that the plants left will have room to grow. This is called thinning.\nIf you've planted lettuce(莴苣)seeds, wait until the baby plants are about 1.5 inches tall.Then pull some of the plants out so that you leave about 8 inches between plants.\nNow that you've done all the work to make a vegetable garden, it's time to enjoy what you've finished. Pick a red, ripe , juicy tomato. Eat it while it's still warm from the sun. Or cut it up and put it in a salad(沙拉)-made with lettuce you picked yourself, If you have more vegetables from your garden than you and your family can eat, give them to friends and neighbors.

I'm going to try.\" Ben jumped into the water.\nThe wind blew the kite high into the air. Ben began to float across the water. Soon he was on the other side, and he had not worked at all.\nOne boy shouted, \"Look at Ben floating across the water! His kite takes him to the other side without any work!\"\n\"Yes,\" said another. \"He's always finding new ways to do things.\"",

He may also say,\"Oh, no. I want to take you to lunch at Smith's,\" or\"I want you to try the Chinese dumplings there. They're great.\" This means the person wants to pay for both of you. If you feel friendly towards this person, you can go with him and you needn't pay for the meal. You may just say,\"Thank you. That would be very nice.\"\nAmerican customs(1) about who pays for dates(2) are much the same as in other parts of the world. In the old days, American women wanted men to pay for all the meals. But, today, a university(3) girl or a woman in business  world will usually pay her way during the day. If a man asks her for a dance outside the working hours, it means  \"Come, as my guest(4).\" So as you can see, it is a polite thing to make the question clear at the very beginning.\nNotes:(1)custom n. 风俗 (2)date n.约会 (3)university n. 大学 (4)guest n. 客人",

They found a huge stone with a sword in it. There was golden writing on the sword which said, \"The man who can pull the sword out of the stone will be king.\" All the knights tried to pull the sword from the stone, but none of them could do it. Arthur was a young boy at the time, but he pulled the sword from the stone and became king.\nArthur lived in the castle of Camelot, with Queen Guinevere. In the castle there was a round table, which was made by Merlin, the magician. All the knights sat around the round table. The most famous knights were Sir Gawain and Sir Galahad. The knights had many adventures. They killed dragons and saved beautiful ladies.\nArthur was killed by his nephew, Sir Mordred. Before he died, he gave his magic sword to his friend Sir Bedivere. He told Sir Bedivere to throw the sword into a lake. A woman's hand came out of the water and caught the sword. Three beautiful queens took Arthur's body away in a boat to the magic island of Avalon. The legend(传说)says that one day Arthur will return to Britain.",

As they grew older, they played together less. They almost stopped speaking to each other, not because they had disagreed with each other about anything, but just because they belonged to different groups. For one thing, Emily was developing into a very good student, while George was more interested in sports. Emily had begun to study French, and she liked French so much that she began to write short plays in French. She also liked television programmes, and for some reason, she enjoyed watching football games very much. Her mother used to say, \"Emily, I've never heard of a girl who likes football as much as you do.\" Mrs. Mason simply did not approve of (赞同) her daughter's interest.\nWhile Emily was working on her French lessons or watching football games on TV, George was working for his father in his store after school. He liked selling things to people. Mr. Peters found George so helpful that he thought about offering him a higher pay.In fact, it was football that brought Emily and George back together. When George was going home one afternoon, he looked in the window of Emily's living-room and he saw that she was watching a football game on TV. He walked up and knocked at the door. Emily was surprised to see him, but she asked him to come in, and they watched the rest of the game together. Emily and George are good friends again. They still have different ideas about things sometimes, but they agree with each other that football is the world's best game. Mrs. Mason doesn't seem to disapprove of her daughter's interest in football as much as she used to.",

But men don't walk without shoes in the snow!In 1906, another climber saw more than footprints. Far off, he saw a very large animal standing on two legs. As he watched, it ran very quickly.Fifteen years later, newspaper had new stories about the \"something\". A mountain climber said he had seen the \"snow man\" walk slowly across the snow, far below him. He said it looked like a very large man.From then on, more and more people had stories to tell. But not until 1951 did a mountain climber bring back pictures of large footprints. The pictures showed clearly that the snowman walked on two legs. Could it be an ape (猿) man? The mystery grew! Someday we may find out just what it is that makes the large footprints.",

One day they met and decided to stay together, sharing(分享) what they had and helping each other in times of trouble.\nSoon a man passed them in the street and gave them a coin(硬币). They talked about what to do with it. At last they decided to buy something to eat.\n\"Let's buy some grapes(葡萄)!\" said the Englishman..\nbut the Turk wanted \"uzum\",the Arab \"aneb\",the Greek \"stafelea\", and the Persian insisted on(坚持) \"angur\".They did not understand each other's language very well. Soon they were quarrelling(争吵) and even fighting.\nWhile they were fighting about how to spend the money, a stranger came along. He knew all five languages. He asked them why they were fighting. After they told him, he said.\n\"Give me your coin. I will buy what you wish.\"\nHe was soon back with a bunch(串)of grapes. Each beggar was happy, as each had what he had wanted.\n根据短文,选择正确答案.",

The weather was bad and the students had to stay indoors . As they couldn't play outdoors , they were unhappy , and some even got into fights from time to time. Some of the teachers , at the college asked Dr. Naismith to invent a game so that the students might have something to play with . It was not easy to invent such a game because it had to be played indoors , and the court was not very large. Dr. Naismith thought for a few days and invented a kind of ball game . It was a fast , wonderful game with much moving and passing of the ball . It was played between two teams . To make a score , the ball had to be thrown into the basket ten feet above the floor on the wall . At each end of the court there was such a basket . At first , Dr. Naismith wanted to throw the ball into a box . As he could not find boxes of the right size , he had to use fruit baskets instead . That is how the game got its name.",

Many of the workers who print newspapers and books, and who weave(织)cloth become deaf. Quite a few people living near airports also become deaf.

Besides, noise produced by jet planes or machines will make people's life difficult and unpleasant, or even make people ill or even drive them mad.\nNowadays the government in many countries have made laws to reduce or control noise and make it less than 85 decibels(分贝).

I found it is as beautiful as many other places of interest. My favorite place was the Sun and Moon Lake. You may ask why people call it so. If you fly high up over the lake and look down around from your plane, you will find the answer yourself. In the middle of this lake, there is a small island(岛屿). People call it Pearl(珍珠) Island because it looks like a pearl. On one side of Pearl Island the lake looks like a sun, and on the other side it looks like a moon. That is why people call the lake the Sun and Moon Lake.\nThere are many mountains around this lake. One of the nearest is the Ali Mountain. We stayed there for three days. We also had a dance party with Gaoshan People. On our first day there we went to the mountain and watched the sun going down slowly in the west. On our last day we got up early and saw a very beautiful sunshine(日出).\nTaiwan is a wonderful place to visit.",

There are fashions in holidays, in restaurants, in films and books. There are even fashions in school subjects, jobs…and in languages.\nFashions change as time goes. If you look at pictures of people or things from the past, you will see that fashions have always changed. An English house of 1750 was different from his grandson in 1860.\nToday fashions change very quickly. Some of this is natural (自然的). We hear about things much more quickly than in the past. Newspapers, radios, telephones and television send information from one country to another in a few hours.\nNew fashions mean that people will buy new things, so you see there is money in fashion.",

This made it easier to carry heavy things and to travel long distances.\nFor hundreds of years after that there were few inventions that had as much effect(影响) as the wheel. Then in the early 1800's the world started to change. There was little unknown land left in the world. People didn't have to explore(探测) much any more. They began to work instead to make life better.\nIn the second half of the 19th century many great inventions were made. Among them were the camera, the light and the radio. These all became a big part of our life today.\nThe first part of the 20th century saw more great inventions. The helicopter in 1909. Movies with sound in 1926. The computer in 1928. And jet planes in 1930. This was also a time when a new material was first made. Nylon came in 1935. It changed the kind of clothes people wear.\nBy this time most people had a very good life, Man has a desire to explore again, The world was known to man but the stars were not. Man began looking for ways to go into space. Russia made the first step. Then the United States took a step. Since then other countries, including China and Japan m have made their steps into space.\nIn 1969 man took his biggest step from the earth. Americans first walked on the moon. This is certainly just a beginning thought. New inventions will some day allow us to do things we have never yet dreamed of.",

This was not because the woods and fields were always far away, but because they were too far from the city to permit people to make a day trip between morning and nightfall.\nIn 1907, a young German schoolmaster had an idea which changed this state of affairs. He decided to turn his little schoolhouse into a dormitory for the summer holidays. Anyone who brought his sleeping bag and cooking equipment along could stay there for a very small amount of money. The idea was a success. A few years later the schoolhouse was much too small to hold the many young people who wanted to stay there. As a result, a dormitory was set up in an old castle nearby. This was the first Young Hostel.\nToday, young students and workers of every country can meet in the hostels and get to know each other. When young people arrive at a hostel, they have only to show their card of membership in a hostel organization in their own country. This card will permit them to use the facilities of hostels all over the world for a very low price.\nOften, at the evening meal, a group of boys and girls from different parts of the country or the world will happen to meet at the same hostel. They may put their food together and prepare a dinner with many kinds of dishes. Sometimes a program will be organized after the meal, with dances, songs, or short talks followed by a question period. One can learn a lot of things about other places, just by meeting people who come from those places. For this reason, a few weeks spent \"hostelling\" can just as useful a part of one's education as classes in school.",

No animals can do what human beings can do. Humans can do many things and feel many things with the hand. The hand can hold onto things and make things because the thumb(拇指) works with the fingers. This fifth finger is strong. Most animals don't have thumbs. The thumb can press against the other fingers. Without a thumb to press against the fingers, it is difficult to hold onto anything. The thumb and fingers can also fit the flat surface of a box and the curved surface of a pencil. We can feel that something is hot or cold, soft or hard, smooth or tough. The hand, with thumb and fingers, is one of the best tools we have. Most animals see a flat picture. Their eyes can only see how high and how wide something is. Some don't see in color. Humans see one picture with both eyes working together. We can see how high and how wide something is. We can also see how far in front of or in back of something a thing is. The brain tells other parts of the body how to work. Some of the things the body does are automatic, that is we don't have to think about them. For example, we don't have to think to make our heart beat or our stomach work. The brain tells the eyes and hands how to make useful and beautiful things. That is how human beings become toolmakers and artists. That is how humans can have richer and better lives than other animals.",

Then he ordered his servants to tell everybody in his capital that if anyone brought him a fish, he would give him anything that he asked for. At last, a fisherman caught a big fish late in the afternoon and hurried to the king's palace with it. But the king's minister would not let him in until he promised to give him half of whatever the king gave him for the fish. The king was very happy when he saw the fish. He asked the fisherman what he wanted for his fish. To his surprise, the fisherman said, \"I want you to beat me two dozen times with a stick.\" When the king began to beat him softly, the fisherman said, \"No, please hit me as hard as you can!\" After the king had hit him a dozen time, the fisherman jumped away and said, \"That is enough for me. I promised the other dozen to your prime minister.\" Then he told the king what had happened between the prime minister and himself. The king was very angry. He not only gave the prime minister the dozen hits, but also said, \"Because you have been dishonest, you will not be my prime minister any more. The fisherman will take your place.\"",

How can I stop getting sick?\nDear Alicia and Natalie,\nInfluenza (In-flew-En-za,流感), or flu, is caused by a group of viruses(病毒). These viruses can easily be passed from one person to another.\nFlu viruses enter your body through your nose or mouth. They are spread from person to person by direct contact with a person infected with the flu, by droplet infection(飞沫传染), or by touching your hand to your nose or mouth. Droplet infection occurs when someone talks, sneezes, or coughs and sprays(喷射) viruses into the air on little droplets of saliva(唾液) or mucus(黏液). You become infected by breathing these droplets in through your nose or mouth.\nIn the United States, flu season can begin as early as November and continue through March, although this can vary by region. Regular handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself from flu viruses, along with avoiding contact with sick people.\nThere are also flu vaccines (疫苗) available that should be given to children with chronic(慢性的)conditions such as asthma (气喘) . Flu vaccine can be given to any healthy child six months of age or older. The vaccine helps to prevent flu and infections and prevent spreading flu to others. There is a new nasal(鼻子的)-spray flu vaccine that will probably be available in the near future. A nasal-spray vaccine would be a nice change from getting another shot!",

The other two days, she gets home early and we argue(争论) about whether she should do her homework right after school, or if she should have some time to rest and play first. When Maria at last sits down to do her homework , she seems to want me there helping all the time. I do want to help her, but I'm sure that she is going to need to be able to do it on her own. And in fact, most of the time, I have other things I need to be doing. It seems that children these days have much more homework than we did, and some of it is really beyond (超越) their abilities (能力). As you can see, I'm really worried about homework and I really don't know what I should do. Any ideas?",

Bad marks(分数)bring parents in as school opens again. This happens again in March, another report card month. May is always the year's busiest month. That's when parents begin to think that their children may be asked to stay in the same grade again. They come in to see if anything can be done before things are decided in June.",

The X-43A is only three to four metres long, but it's very heavy: it weighs(重)1,270 kilogrammes.\nNews 2\nHave you ever got angry at books that are full of mistakes? Don't worry, things will get better soon. Last week, China started checking textbooks, dictionaries and children's books all over the country. The government(政府)said the results of the checking would come out at the end of June.\nNews 3\nThere will be a new\"star\"in the sky soon. China plans to send a satellite into space by December 2006. It will stay in space for one year. It will go around the moon and take pictures. It must be very expensive, right? That's for sure---1. 4 billion yuan!\nNews 4\nFloods(洪水)across the northern Mexican state of Coahuila killed at least 32 people and left100 more missing. It was reported on Monday.

Often you have a cough later. It's not a serious disease, but you can feel quite bad.\nThere isn't a cure (良药 ) for a cold, but you can take medicines to make you feel better. For example, you can take aspirin (阿司匹林) to get rid of your headache. It is good to rest, and to drink a lot of water, too. A doctor once told me,\"With the right medicine, a cold will last for seven days. With no medicine, it will go on for a whole week!\"\nWhere does our medicine come from? A long time ago, people understood that some plants made them feel better. They ate the leaves, the roots (根), the fruit or the seeds (种子) of plants. For example, the juice of lemons (柠檬) makes a sore throat feel better. In modern times, scientists have looked at these plants, and found out which chemicals (化学药品) are in them. Many of our medicines today are made from those chemicals. There are some diseases that we can't cure yet. And nobody has found a cure for old age.

I learned in the newspaper that tickets could be bought at the cinema box office in Richland Hills any day between 10:00 and 4:00. Since I work from\n9:00 to 5:30, the only time I could go to the cinema was during my 45 minute lunchtime. It is a pity that the cinema is on other side of the town and the bus service between my office and Richland Hills is not very good. But if you are lucky, you can make the round trip in 45 minutes. Last Monday, I stood at the bus stop for fifteen minutes waiting for a bus. By the time I saw one come round the corner, there was not enough time left to make the trip, so I had to go back to the office. The same thing happened on Tuesday, and again on Wednesday. On Thursday my luck changed. I got on a bus right away and arrived at the cinema in twenty minutes. But when I got there, I found a long line of people at the box office. I heard one man said he had been waiting in line for over an hour. I found that I would not have enough time to wait in line. I caught the next bus and went back across the town. By Friday I understand my only hope was to make the trip by car. It was expensive, but I felt it would be worth it to see the film. The trip by car only took 10 minutes, but it felt like an hour to me. When I reached the cinema, I was delighted to see that nobody was waiting in line. But I quickly found out that it was because they had already sold out the tickets.",

One winter morning the old woman got up early. She was going to buy some food in a shop. And when she came out, she found there was much snow in the street. She had to sweep it away. And suddenly she found a dying dog at the corner of the house. She picked it up and took it into the house quickly. She put it near the fire and gave it some milk and bread. At first the poor dog ate nothing and that afternoon it drank some milk and three days later it was all right. Now the old woman found it was a beautiful dog. And she liked it very mach and took it everywhere she went. A week later she went shopping with her dog. At a bus stop a young man was eating fish and chips. The little dog became very excited at the smell of the man's lunch and began jumping up at him. \"Do yon mind if I throw it a bit?\" asked the young man. \"Not at all,\" answered Mrs White.

The man moved his head from side to side. The waitress understood him and took away the tea. In a moment, she brought a cup of coffee and put it on the table. The man again moved his head from side to side. He moved his head from side to side whenever the waitress~ brought him something to drink. She brought him a lot of different drinks, but drinks are not food, of\ncourse.\nWhen the man was going away, another man came in. This man saw the waitress, and put his hands on the stomach. That was enough. In a few minutes, there was a large plate of meat and vegetables on the table in front of him.\nSo, you see, we can't understand the language of signs so well as the language of words.",

I didn't know who he was. He was in trouble and I could tell that he was worried about something. He gave me his address and asked me to send an ambulance* right away. I asked him if somebody was hurt, but he didn't answer my question. He told me he needed a doctor at once, so I said I'd call an ambulance for him. I still wanted to know what was wrong. Then he said. \"Our keys are gone.\" I didn't understand that. Why would he need an ambulance just because he couldn't find his keys ? Then I found out what the trouble was. The man and his wife left the car keys on a coffee table, and later they couldn't find them. Their little boy John was playing in the room, and they thought heswallowed* them.

When you read, you can not only learn some new words, but also learn how to use these English words. When you read, it gives you a good example for writing.\nSecrets of good reading:\nTry to read at the right level(水平). Read something that you can understand. If you need to stop every three words to use a dictionary, it is not interesting.\nTry to increase(增加) the number of your new words. If there are four or five new words on a page, write them in your notebook. But you don't have to write them while you read. Instead, try to guess their meaning as you read: mark (作记号)with them with a pen. Then come back when you have finished reading to look them up in a dictionary and write them in your vocabulary and write them in your own vocabulary book. Then try to remember them.\nTry to read regularly(有规律). For example, read for a short time once a day. Fifteen minutes every day is better than two hours every Sunday. Fix(固定) a time to read and keep to it. For example, you could read for fifteen minutes when you go to bed, or when you get up or at lunchtime.\nRead what interests you.

I'm good at it. I'm very glad to tell you something about how I study English.\nFirst, I think an interest(爱好)in English is very important. When I was in Grade One, we had a new subject \nC English. It was fresh for me . I was interested in it, so I worked hard at it. Soon we had an English exam and I got a very good mark. How happy I was! After that, I learned English harder and harder. Our English teacher often teaches us English songs, the songs sound nice. I often think how interesting English is!\nSecond, I think English is a foreign language. I should learn it well in the following ways: Listen to the teacher carefully, speak bravely, read aloud and have a good vocabulary(词汇). Then practice again and again, never be tired. And I also have a good habit: Asking whenever(不论何时)I have a question, I must make it clear by asking our English teacher. How happy I am when I understand!\nBesides this, I often read English stories, jokes and easy novels. From these I know English is not only interesting, but also useful. They help me understand a lot of things. So to do more reading is an important way to learn English well.\nAnd I also do some exercises from our class magazines, and I often write English diaries. English has become a close friend of mine.\nNow I have learned English for more than two years. I always keep the first position in our school. From these words, I hope every student can learn English well.",

Hanna changed her name to Anne because she thought it would be easier for people to remember. On the other hand, Joseph is thinking about changing his name to an unusual name because she wants to be different.\nPeople have a lot of reasons for changing their names. Film stars, singers, sportsmen and some other famous people often change their names because they want names that are not ordinary, or that have special sound. They chose the \"new name\" for themselves instead of the name their parents gave them when they were born.\nSome people have another reason for changing their names. They have moved to a new country and want to use a name that is usual there. For example, Li Kaiming changed his name to Ken Lee when he moved to the United States. He uses the name Ken at his job and at school. But with his family and Chinese friends, he uses Li Kaiming. For some people, using different names makes life easier in their new country.\nIn many countries, a woman changes her family name to her husband's after she gets married. But today, many women are keeping their own family name and not using their husband's. Sometimes, women use their own name in some situations(情况)and their husband's in other situations.

However, they all had different numbers of days in a week and different numbers of hours in a day.\nIn 1584, a scientist called Simon Stevenius started to think about a set of measures which used the number ten, but no one was interested in his ideas. About two hundred years later, a group of scientists in France decided to use his ideas. They thought of ways to measure everything using ten. Some of their ideas weren't popular. One was a new clock which had ten hours a day. The other was a new calendar which had ten days a week.\nThe scientists agreed to use meters to measure length and they worked out how long a meter should be. Then they decided to call one hundredth of a meter a centimeter and a thousand meters a kilometer.",

A student collected in the papers when the exam ended.\n\"That test was not only a test of knowledge, but also a test of moral (道德). We wanted to show students how important honesty (诚实) is,\" said Cai Wenguo , the school's headmaster. The school says no cheating (作弊)happened in the test.

And the students will not be able to ask for help when needed, 99 said Hua Sha.\n\"I don' t like having invigilators in exams. When they walk around the classroom, they make me nervous. I would get higher marks without them in the room because I would feel more relaxed,\" Liu Qingxi said.\n\"I think it's very important to have invigilators in exams. Many students want to check their answers with each other after they have finished papers. And they can also keep the classroom in order when something unusual happens. They may make me nervous, but I still think we need them,\" Shangguan Yuan said.\nNot using invigilators may be a good idea.

And why do people get so afraid if it?\nA computer virus is, in fact, a little program that is put into other programs and that does something bad. It is called a virus because, like any real life viruses such as AIDS virus, it reproduces (繁殖) itself. And when these programs are run, the virus is brought to life. It hides itself in your computer waiting for the right moment to make damages. And at the same time it keeps reproducing itself by copying itself onto their programs.\nThe Michelangelo virus wait until the artist's birthday comes around, and then it will wake up to do very bad things like destroying files.

It is the Pacific Ocean(太平洋) to the east of Fujian.\nLast week I took a group of French_holidaymakers_for a week's trip to Taiwan. We travel all around the island. I found it is as beautiful as many other places of interest. My favorite place was the Sun and Moon Lake. You may ask why people call it so. If you fly high up over the lake and look down around from your plane, you will find the answer yourself. In the middle of this lake, there is a small island(岛屿). People call it Pearl(珍珠) Island because it looks like a pearl. On one side of Pearl Island the lake looks like a sun, and on the other side it looks like a moon. That is why people call the lake the Sun and Moon Lake.\nThere are many mountains around this lake. One of the nearest is the Ali Mountain. We stayed there for three days. We also had a dance party with Gaoshan People. On our first day there we went to the mountain and watched the sun going down slowly in the west. On our last day we got up early and saw a very beautiful sunshine(日出).\nTaiwan is a wonderful place to visit.",

High school students have only four or five subjects each term. They usually go to the same classes every day, and they have homework for every class.

Such students felt that they are hated by everyone else they meet and they don't want to go to school any longer. They become dropouts.\nIt is surprising that thought most Japanese parents are worried about their children, they do not help them in any way. Many parents feel that they are not able to help their children and that it is the teachers' work to help their children. To make matters worse, a lot of parents send their children to those schools opening in the evenings and on weekends-they only help students to pa exams and never teach students any real sense(判断) of the world. It is a great surprise that almost three-quarters of middle school students have been to such kind of schools.\nMany Japanese schools usually have rules(规章) about everything from the student s' hair to their clothes and the things in their school bags. Child psychologists (心理学家) now think that such strict rules are harmful(有伤害的) to the feeling s of the students.

But the factory is easy to build and costs little.\nThat is why people in many dry places talk about Symi!",

I'm now writing to ask you something about American social customs .My American friends want me to join them in their dinner party. I am very happy and have decided to go, but I'm a little worried about it, too. The social customs in my country are very different from here, so I'm afraid of making mistakes. Should I bring a present, such as sweets or flowers? Should I arrive on time or a little late? At the dinner table, how can I know which fork or knife to use? How can I let the family know that I'm thankful for their kindness? Wang Lin Dear Wang Lin, It's a good idea to bring a small present when you go to a dinner party. Flowers are always nice, or you may bring a bottle of wine if you know that your friends drink it. You should arrive on time or five to ten minutes late. Don't get there early. If you're going to be more than fifteen minutes late, you should call and tell them. Try to be free at the dinner table. If you don' t know about choosing the right fork or knife, just watch the other people, and follow them. If you still have no idea of what to do, ask the person next to you. If you like the food, say so. Of course, you'll thank them for the meal and for their kindness. It's also a good idea to send a thank you card the day after. Rose",

Many of the world's great cities are located(坐落)on rivers, and almost every country has at least one river flowing through it that plays an important part in the lives of its people.\nSince the beginning of history, people have used rivers for transportation. The longest one in the United States is the Mississippi. The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile. To the people of India, the Ganges is great, but it is also important for transportation; ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in Southeast Asia. The greatest of all for navigation(航海), however, is the Amazon in Brazil. It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles upon it.\nBesides transportation, rivers give food, water to drink, water for crops, and chances for fun and recreation(消遣,娱乐)for the people who live along their banks. In order to increase the supply of water for crops, engineers sometimes build a dam(大坝) across a river and let a lake form behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate(灌溉) their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries.\nHowever, large cities and industries that are located upon rivers often make problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals and other materials. People are learning the importance, however, of doing more to keep their rivers clean if they want to enjoy the benefits(利益) of this natural resource.",

Some solids are small and some are big. A pencil is solid matter that you can carry. A bus is solid matter that can carry you. Another kind of matter is liquid. Liquids flow. They have no shape of their own. They take the shape of whatever is holding them. The water in a pool is liquid(液体)matter. You can swim in it. The third kind of matter is gas(气体). Gases have no shape. They fill up open spaces. Most gases are clear. Gases are always around us. The air is made of gases. Some drinks have bubbles(气泡) which are gases, too.\nCan matter change? Yes, matter can change. Heating and cooling can change one form of matter into another. Solids can change into liquids. When ice cream melts(融化), it change from solid to liquid.

Each foot is on the ground for more than half the time, so there are times when both feet are on the ground. In running, each foot is on the ground for less than half the time, and there are times when both feet are off the ground. In hopping, the feet move almost at the same time. This means that for much of the time both feet are off the ground.\nMiddle-sized and large birds walk at low speeds and either run or hop at higher speeds. Small birds usually do not walk—walking may be too slow for them. It seems that the more time a bird spends in trees, the more likely it is to hop. Perhaps there are wide gaps in a tree between one thin branch and the next, so walking is not a good choice, while on each small branch there is enough room to set both feet down side by side, so hopping seems to make sense.",

When he arrived, he bounced (蹦蹦跳跳) happily up the stairs to the doorway of the house. He looked through the doorway with his ears lifted high and his tail (尾巴) wagging as fast as it could. To his great surprise, he found himself staring (盯着) at 1,000 other happy little dogs with their tails wagging just as fast as his. He smiled a great smile, and was answered with 1,000 great just as warm and friendly. As he left the House, he thought to himself. \"This is a wonderful place. I will come back and visit it often.\"\nIn the small village, another little dog, who was not quite happy as the first one, decided to visit the House. He slowly climbed the stairs and hung his head low as he looked into the door. When he saw the 1,000 unfriendly looking dogs staring back at him, he growled (狂吠) at them and was horrified (恐惧) to see 1,000 little dogs growling back at him. As he left, he thought to himself. \"That is a horrible place, and I will never go back there again.\"\nAll the faces in the world are mirrors. What kind of reflections (映像) do you see in the faces of the people you meet?",

He put it in a window of his house and took a picture of his garden. That was the first photo. The next important date in the history of photography (摄影术) was in 1837. That year, Daguerre, another Frenchman, took a picture of his reading room. He used a new kind of camera in a different way. In his picture you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest thing. This kind of photo was called a Daguerreotype. Soon, other people began to use Daguerre's way. Travellers brought back wonderful photos from all around the world. People took pictures of famous buildings, cities and mountains. In about 1840, photography was developed. Then photographers could take picture of people and moving things. That was not simple. The photographers had to carry a lot of film and other machines. But this did not stop them, for example, some in the United States worked so hard. Mathew Brady was a famous American photographers. He took many picture of great people. The pictures were unusual because they were very lifelike(栩栩如生的). Photographers also became one kind of art by the end of the 19th century. Some photos were not just copies of the real world. They showed ideas and feelings, like other kinds of art.",

One of the things he discovered was that the Chinese used paper money. In western countries, people did not use paper money until the 15thcentury. However, people in China began to use paper money in the 7thcentury.\nA Chinese man called Cai Lun invented paper almost 2,000 years ago. He made it from wood. He took the wood from trees and made it into paper. He then put these pieces of together and made them into a book.\nNow paper still comes from trees. We used a lot of paper every day. If we keep on wasting so much paper, there will not be any trees left on the earth. If there are no trees, there will be no paper. Every day , people throw away about 2,800 tons (吨) of paper in our city. It takes 17 trees to make one ton of paper. This means that we are cutting nearly 48,000 trees\nevery day . Since it takes more than 10 years for a tree to grow, we must start using less paper now. If we don\"t , we will not have enough time to grow more trees to take the place of those we use for paper.\nSo how can we save paper? We can use both sides of every piece of paper, especially when we are making notes. We can choose drinks in bottles instead of those in paper packets. We can also use cotton handkerchiefs(手帕) and not paper ones. When we go shopping ,we can use fewer paper bags. If the shop assistant does give us\na paper bag, we can save it and reuse it later.\nEveryone can help to save paper. If we all think carefully, we can help protect trees. But we should do it now, before it is too late.",

You'd die of thirst while waiting for a passing plane that never comes.\nBut don't dismiss the thought as a nightmare (噩梦). Your hometown could become a desert if nothing is done to prevent it.\nDeserts are eating land at high speed. In China, desertification (沙漠化) has affected 2,622,000 square kilometres, equal to 14 Guangdong Provinces, mostly in the North. Deserts are advancing at a pace of 2,460 kilometres per year.\nAccording to the UN, one － third of the planet's land surface, with one billion people, has become desert. Africa, Asia and Latin America have the driest land in danger of desertification.\nRecognizing the threat (威胁) to human beings, the United Nations has named 2006 the International Year of Deserts and Desertification.\nIt wants to increase pubblic awareness (关注) of advancing deserts. Activities include a film festival in Rome with films on life in unproductive (贫瘠的) lands. Meetings will discuss international cooperation, such as planting trees and changing agricultural practices.\nDesertification takes place where rain is little and the climate hot. But human activities are the biggest cause. Land turns into desert when the soil is over － farmed and too many animals eat up plants. To make money, people also cut down trees that hold the soil.\nDesertification brings serious problems. From 1991 to 2000, droughts (干旱) killed over 280,000 people worldwide. When land becomes useless, there's a big loss in food production.\nDust from deserts is blown into cities around the world. Each spring, Beijing is at risk of yellow dust from the Gobi Desert. Dust from Africa reaches cities in the US and Europe, leading to illnesses and worsening environments.",

The USDA has prepared a food guide to help people learn about which kind of food is the healthiest to eat. The food guide describes six main food groups: meat (like fish and chicken), dairy (like milk and cheese), grains (like bread and rice), fruit, and vegetables. The last group is fats and sweets. The USDA also suggests(建议) how much of each food group is healthy to eat daily. Though this guide was prepared by the US government, it is very useful for people all over the world.\nAs a result of years of study, we know that too much animal fat is bad for our health. For example, Americans eat a lot of meat and only a small amount(量) of grains, fruit and vegetables. Because of the way they eat, they have a high rate(率) of cancer(癌症) and heart disease. In Japan, people eat large amounts of grains and very little meat. The Japanese also have a very low rate of cancer and heart disease. The Japanese live longer than anyone else in the world. However , when Japanese people move to the US , the rate of heart disease and cancer goes up as their eating habit changes. And as hamburgers, ice creams and other high-fat foods become popular in Japan , the rate of heart disease and cancer is going up there as well. People are also eating more meat and dairy food in other countries, in which the disease rate is going up along with the change of the way people eat. Doctors everywhere suggest people eat more grains, fruit and vegetables and less meat and dairy food.\nEating healthily is important for children as well as their parents. When parents have poor eating habits, their children usually do, too. After all, children eat the same way as their parents. When parents eat healthy food, the children will learn to enjoy it, too. Then they will develop good eating habits. Doctors suggest parents give their children healthier food such as fruit, vegetables and juice.\nEveryone wants to live a long, healthy life. We know that the food we eat affects(影响) us in different ways. For example, doctors believe that fruit and vegetables can really protect people from many different diseases. On the other hand, animal fat can cause(引起) diseases. We can change our eating habits now and enjoy many years of healthy living.",

The money from the books helped to pay for all the food that these animals ate.\nOne day, when Mr King was out looking for drinking water, he found oil. He needed money for his travels and for his zoo, and a little oil would buy enough water for what he needed all his life, but he knew that if he told anybody else about it, it would be the end of his zoo and his life's work. So he decided not to tell anyone about what he had found, because oil and water couldn't mix.",

He found nothing wrong with him. \"You are a very healthy (健康的) man,\" said the doctor. \"You only think you are ill and so make yourself unhappy.\" The king was very angry when he heard this. He told his soldiers to cut off the doctor's head. The second doctor knew he had to be careful. \"oh, King, you will be well if you wear the shoes of a man who is always happy,\" he said. The king was pleased with his answer and thought that the doctor was very clever. He gave the doctor a bag of gold. The king asked hundreds of people if they were always happy. They all said they were sometimes happy and sometimes sad (悲伤的). At last he met a beggar (乞丐). The beggar said that he was always happy. \"Give me your shoes quickly,\" said the king, \"and I will make you a very rich man.\" The beggar laughed, \"I am sorry,\" he answered, \"I never wear shoes!\"",

It has a population of nearly three million, which is half the population of Massachusetts.\nBoston was founded in 1630. The American Revolution began here when the people of Boston took up their arms to fight their English rulers. The Boston Tea Party is one of the most famous happenings in American history. Americans were very fond of tea, and much tea was brought to the port of Boston. The British government was looking for more ways to get money out of America colonies(殖民地). So it put a big tax(税) on tea. That made the Bostonians angry. They rushed (涌到)to the port and onto a ship there. They threw all the tea into the sea. This led to a war between the people of Boston and the British soldiers. Thus the American Revolution began.\n注释:\nMassachusetts 马萨诸塞(美国东北部的一个州)",

Of course, it is not surprising that the human's nose has given to the languages many interesting expressions. Cyrano de Bergerac said that a large nose showed a great man �C brave, manly, and clever.\nHistorically, man's nose has had an important role in his imagination. Man has referred to(参考) the nose in many ways to express his emotions.\nIn English there are a number of phrases about the nose. For example,_to hold up one's nose_, expressed a basic human feeling―pride. People can hold up their noses at people, things and places.\nThe phrase,_to be led around by the nose_,shows man's weakness. A person who is led around by the nose lets other people control him. On the other hand, person who follows his nose lets his instinct(本能) guide him.\nFor the human emotion of rejection(拒绝), the phrase,to have one's nose put out of joint, is very interesting. The expression is for persons who have been turned aside because of a competitor. Their pride is hurt and they feel rejected. This expression is not new. It was used by Erasmus in 1542.\nThis is only a part of expressions in English dealing with the nose. There are numbers of others. Nose is more than an organ(器官) for breathing and smelling!",

Many students have fallen asleep during class at one time or another. Too much homework is not the only reason why students stay up late.

Don't get nervous or excited. This will help you with your listening.\n●Listen carefully to the first sentence.\nThe first sentence tells a lot about the whole passage *. For example, if at the very beginning, you hear\"Many shops in many parts of China have decided to take away all kinds of Japanese goods*off their shelves, but some people say it's not a good idea.\", you know you will hear a piece of news, not a chil­dren's story, or a science report.\n●Think when you're listening.\nWhen you're listening, try to do some thinking. For example, you can think of the following questions:What happened? When,where and how? What was the result and what does the speaker want to tell us?This way, you may understand the pas­sage better.\n●Listen for important facts.\nIt's important for you to remember some important facts. For example, if the passage is a science report, you should try to remember its findings and how the sci­entists got their results.\n●Don't think about one or two words for too long.\nYou may hear some words that you don't know, but don't spend too much time on them. Very often, you'11 find out what they mean later when you go on with the lis­tening. But you can remember some words or sentences that you think are important, and you can use them when you're answering the questions.",

Tom could see the gun in the man' s hand, but the man didn't see or hear Tom. Tom hurried up to the street. He looked for the police, but he didn't see any. Then Tom saw an old baseball bat lying in the street. \"Maybe this will help,\" he thought. He ran back with it. His father was just giving some of the money to the man. The man was watching Tom's father. Tom knew he could not wait long. \"Now is the time. I must do it now.\" Tom went up to the man and knocked him down with the bat. Tom and his father then ran outside. This time they got the police and told them what had happened. The police quickly went to the shop and caught the man.",

On the first day of class, he gave us a lecture about a creature called the cattywampus , an animal that was wiped out (灭绝) during the Ice Age. He passed around a skull (头骨) as he talked. We all took notes and later had a test. When he returned my paper, I was shocked. There was a big red \"X\" through each of my answers. I had failed. There had to be some mistake! I had written down exactly what Mr. Whitson said. Then I realized that everyone in the class had failed. What had happened? \"Very simple.\" Mr. Whitson explained.  He had made up all those things about cattywampus. There had never been any such animal. The information in our notes was wrong. Did we expect praise (表扬) for wrong answers? We were very angry. What kind of test was that? And what kind of teacher? We should have figured it out (弄……明白),Mr. Whitson said. At the very moment he was passing around that cattywampus skull, hadn't he been telling us that no trace (迹象) of the animal remained (存在)? He had described its color and other facts he couldn' t have known. He had given the animal a strange name, and we still hadn' t been suspicious (有疑心的). The zeroes on our papers would be recorded in his grade book, he said. And they were. Mr. Whitson said he hoped we would learn something from this experience. Teachers and notebooks are not never wrong. In fact, no one is. He told us not to let our minds go to sleep and to speak up if we ever thought he or textbook was wrong. I haven't made any great scientific discoveries (科学发现), but Mr. Whitson' s class gave me and my classmates something just as important: the courage (勇气) to look people in the eye and tell them they are wrong.

You can travel three or four hundred miles or only fifty or one hundred miles a day, just as you like. You can stop wherever you wish----where there is something interesting to see, at a good restaurant where you can enjoy a good meal, or at a hotel to spend the night.

Families sometimes name their children after a close friend. Many places are named after men and women, if they are friendly to people in a town. Some libraries are named this way. So are some schools. We think of these people when we go to these places.\nThere's more good news for people, if they have friends.

You watched and listened. You began to know that people make some sounds to go with some things.\nThen you began to try to make sounds you heard. And step by step you were able to make the right sound for one thing.\nOn that day you came to understand the secret of the language. The secret is that a certain sound means a certain thing. One sound might be as good as another. But it is not as good as a word unless everyone agrees on its meaning. Only when a group of people use the same set of sounds of things, they can understand each other, so these people have a language.\nAfter you found the secret of language, you learned words. Some of the words meant things, such as books, chairs and shops. Some of the words meant action such as go and swim. And other words describe things such as good or dirty. Soon you learnt to put words together to express one's idea, such as\" I want to go out and play with my friends.\" This is language. By the way of language people can communicate.

Finally they decided to kill the hawks.\nThe farmers killed many hawks. They no longer had to worry about their chickens. But they now had a new worry. Field mice (老鼠) were eating up a lot of the farmers' grain ( food plants).\nHow did this happen?\nHawks eat not only chickens but also field mice. They eat more field mice than chickens. But the farmers did not know this. When they killed a lot of hawks, they changed the balance (平衡) of nature ( 自然界 ).\nWhen people move into a new place, they often destroy (破坏) many wild plants. Oftenthese plants are food for the animals. If the animals cannot find enough plants to eat, they will go hungry or have to leave the place.\nIn one part of the United States, for example, the deer (鹿) there like to eat a kind of wild rose (some plants). The mountain lions there eat the deer. The number of deer, mountain lions, and wild roses does not change much. But people killed many mountain lions to protect the deer. Soon there were so many deer that they ate up all the wild roses. Then the deer began to eat the green leaves of young trees. These trees were important to the farmers. So the farmers thought of ways to protect their trees. Now the deer had nothing to eat, and many of them died. This was another lesson from nature.\nTo keep the balance of nature is important for us to remember.",

On the first day of class, he gave us a lecture about a creature called the cattywampus, an animal that was wiped out (灭绝) during the Ice Age. He passed around a skull (头骨) as he talked. We all took notes and later had a test.\nWhen he returned my paper, I was shocked. There was a big red \"X\" through each of my answers. I had failed. There had to be some mistake! I had written down exactly what Mr. Whitson said. Then I realized that everyone in the class had failed. What had happened?\n\"Very simple. \" Mr. Whitson explained. He had made up all those things about cattywampus. There had never been any such animal. The information in our notes was wrong. Did we expect praise (表扬) for wrong answers?\nWe were very angry. What kind of test was that? And what kind of teacher?\nWe should have figured it out (弄……明白) , Mr. Whitson said. At the very moment he was passing around that cattywampus skull, hadn't he been telling us that no trace (迹象) of the animal remained (存在) ? He had described its color and other facts he couldn't have known. He had given the animal a strange name, and we still hadn' t been suspicious (有疑心的). The zeroes on our papers would be recorded in his grade book, he said. And they were.\nMr. Whitson said he hoped we would learn something from this experience. Teachers and notebooks are not never wrong. In fact, no one is. He told us not to let our minds go to sleep and to speak up if we ever thought he or textbook was wrong.\nI haven't made any great scientific discoveries (科学发现) , but Mr. Whitson's class gave me and my classmates something just as important: the courage (勇气) to look people in the eye and tell them they are wrong.

More than half of the women at the age of eighteen to sixty-five have good jobs. In general, working women have more education than those who stay at home.\nAmong women with jobs, eight out of ten drive a car to work, and most of them often spend their holidays away from home. They like traveling by air. Women's work had made several changes in women's lives and in men's lives, too.\nBut things are quite different from those in the Middle East countries.\nIn the Middle East countries, women have to stay at home. Their duty is to look after their families and do all the housework. They can't find work outside. When they go out in public, they cover their faces with something and walk behind their husbands.\nFor the past few years the women's life has been changing in those countries.

            "context": "American and British people both speak English, of course, but sometimes it does not seem like the same language. In face, there are some important differences between British and American English.\nFirst of all, they sound very different. Often, Americans don\"t say all the letters in each word especially the sounds like \"t\" and \"d\". However, the British usually pronounce their consonants(辅音)more carefully.\nAlso, some letters have different sounds. For example, Americans say the \"a\" in \"half\" like the \"a\" in \"cat, \" but the British say the \"a\" in \"half\" like the \"o\" in \"soft.\" The \"r\" is sometimes said differently, too. When an American says \"farmer, \" you can usually hear the \"r.\" But you can\"t hear the \"r\" in British English. The British say \"fahmah\".\nSound is not the only difference. The two languages have different words for some things, for example, the words for clothing are different. Americans use the word \"sweater,\" but the British say \"jumper.\"\nMany expressions(短语)are also different in the two countries. In England, if you are going to telephone friends, you \"ring them up.\" In America, you \"give them a call.\"\nThere are also some differences in grammar.\nThese differences can be confusing(令人疑惑)if you are learning English. But there is a reason for the difference. Languages change over time. When the same language is used in different places, it changes differently in each place. This is what happened to English. It also happened to other languages, such as French. Many people in Canada speak French, but their French is different from the French spoken in France.",

That\"s because Markita Andrews has got more than eight thousand dollars selling Girl Scout cookies since she was seven years old.\nGoing door-to-door after school, the terribly shy Markita changed herself into the cookie-selling dynamo(高手).\nIt starts with great wish.\nFor Markita and her mother, whose husband left them when Markita was eight years old, their dream was to travel the world. \"I\"ll work hard to make enough money to send you to college,\" her mother said one day. \"When you leave college, you\"ll make enough money to take you and me around the world. Okay?\"\nSo at the age of 13 when Markita read in herGirl Scoutmagazine that the Scout(童子军)who sold the most cookies would win a free trip for two around the world, she decided to sell all the Girl Scout cookies she could&#0;more Girl Scout cookies than anyone in the world, ever.\nWish, however, alone is not enough. To make her dream come true, Markita knew she needed a plan.\n\"When you are doing business, wear your Girl Scout clothes when you go up to people in their building, \" her aunt told her. \"Always smile, whether they buy something or not and always be nice.\"\nLots of other Scouts may have wanted that trip around the world, but only Markita went off in her own uniform each day after school, ready to ask&#0;and keep asking&#0;people to help in her dream.\nMarkita sold 3,526 boxes of Girl Scout cookies that year and won her trip around the world. Since then, she has sold more than 42,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies.\nMarkita is no cleverer than thousands of other people, with dreams of their own. The difference is that many people fail before they even begin. They fear(恐惧)that they will be refused. This fear leads many of us to refuse ourselves and prevents us from getting where we have set off for long before anyone else ever has the chance&#0;no matter what we are selling.\n\"It takes courage(勇气)to ask for what you want,\" she said. \"Courage is not that you don\"t have fear. It means doing what it takes although you have a fear of it\".",

African brown parrots(鹦鹉)are the birds best known for this. Every December in London, the National Cage and Aviary Bird Show tries to find the best \" talking\" bird in the world. One bird named Prudle was the best among the \"talking birds\". She won for 12 years from 1965 to 1976. Prudle came out from her egg in Uganda in 1958. She was sold to Iris Frost in Seafold, England. Prudle knew almost 800 words in English. Prudle was also the oldest bird in the world that lived in a cage. Ms. Frost took care of the bird until Prudle died in 1994. Prudle was 35 years old. A different kind of bird, not a parrot, named Puck had a match with Prudle in 1993. Puck knew more English words than Prudle knew. Puck knew 1,700 words. If a bird can do it, anybody can do it.",

Football for example, has spread around the world. Swimming is popular in all countries near the sea or in those with many rivers.\nSome sports or games go back thousands of years, like running or jumping. Chinese boxing, for example, has a very long history. But basketball and volleyball are rather new. Neither one is a hundred years yet. People are inviting new sports or games all the time.\nPeople from different countries may not understand each other, but after a game they often become good friends. Sports help to train a person's character. One learns to fight hard but fight fair, to win without pride and to lose with grace(文雅).",

Most of the restaurants in large towns have foreign owners and serve foreign food. When visitors are invited to eat in an English home, their hosts often feel they must offer them something foreign and exotic.\nThose of us who do know English food realize that at its best it can be really very good. On the other hand it is true to say that it is sometimes terrible. Part of the problem is that we are not really interested in food---we eat to live, we don't live to eat. So we don't generally spend the necessary time and effort needed to cook really good meals or ready prepared food which only, needs heating up before eating.\nYou can find the best English food in the country away from large towns, where life is slower and people not in such a hurry. But more visitor come to London, they come because they are interested in shopping and sightseeing. They do not come because of food, so why should they complain about it?",

In another, failure may be regarded as a step towards success.\nThe \"spider-story\" is often told as an example of this. Robert Bruce, leader of the Scots in the 13thcentury, was hiding in a hole on a hill from the English. He watched a spider making a web. Bruce is said to have got confidence from this and to have gone on to beat the English. Edison, too, the inventor of the light bulb(电灯泡), made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one.\nSo what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were you in high spirit then? What can you change so that things will go right the next time?\nSecond, is the goal (目标) you are trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be. Think about this question: \"If I am successful in this, what will it get me\" This may help to prevent(阻止) failure in the things you shouldn't be doing anyway.\nThe third thing to remember about failure is that it's a part of life. Learn to \"live with yourself\" even though you may have failed. Remember, \"You can't win them all.\"",

Didn\"t it cost you anything? Boy, I wish....\"He hesitated(犹豫).\nOf course Paul knew what he was going to wish for. He was going to wish he had a brother like that.

He thought he knew what the boy wanted. He wanted to show his neighbors that he could ride home in a big car. But Paul was wrong again. \"Will you stop where those two steps are?\"the boy asked.\nHe can up to the steps. Then in a short while Paul heard him coming back, but he was not coming fast. He was carrying his little crippled(残疾)brother. He sat him down on the step and pointed to the car.\n\"There she is, Buddy, just like I told you upstairs. His brother gave it to him for Christmas and it didn\"t cost him a cent. And some day I\"m going to give you one just like it... then you can see for yourself all the nice things in the Christmas window that I\"ve been trying to tell you about.\"\nPaul got out and lifted the boy to the front seat of his car.

How about making one of them into an international language? English has been worked on for this purpose. A basic(基本的)word list of 850 English words named Basic English was made. These are the only verb in the whole list: \"come, go, give, keep, let, do, put make, say, be, seem, may, will, have, send.\"Writing in Basic English may require(要求)you to use a greater number of words �C�C�C as in having to say\"it came to my ear\"instead of\"I heard\"�C�C�C but you can still say anything you want to with just 850 different words and a few suffixes and prefixes. This is a much smaller number of words to have to be memorized(记忆)than ordinary words offered to students of a foreign language.\nBut people have always had a need to do more than simply\"tell it as it is\". Language is for reporting not only one\"s work. For this, a language needs all kinds of grammar and style that throw back its history and development just as a person needs eyebrows(眉毛). Is there some special reason why our lips(嘴唇)should be a different colour from the rest of our face? Perhaps not, but this is how people �C�C�C real people �C�C are.

She was very beautiful. \"This must belong to my mother,\" I thought. We were having a class about family trees and I thought grandmother's photo would be good for the lesson. So I took it to school and showed my friends. Unluckily, I couldn't find it after that class. Later, when I got home from school, I told my mother about the photo. She was very sad and cried. I thought it must be the only picture she had of her mother. I felt sad. I still do.\nLiu Meifeng\n\nI must be one of those people who always have the worst luck at the worst time. Once I was on a weekend hike with my class. The teacher told us to be careful. I fell just as she finished talking and what was worse, my glasses were missing. I can't see without my glasses! I thought it could be the end of my trip. But everyone said I shouldn't be so sad and they would help me. Some classmates helped me when I walked and others told me about the wonderful birds and trees they were seeing. Sometimes when you lose something, you might find friends in its place. Later, someone noticed something in my shirt pocket and asked what it was. I touched my pocked. \"It must be my glasses!\" Everyone laughed.\nDave Brown\n\nEveryone always said my grandfather must be very rich. They were always trying to guess where he kept his money because he always said his money would be lost if he put it in the banks. But no one ever found it. After he died, his relatives(亲戚) got the many different things that belonged to him. When they asked me what I wanted, I asked if I could have his books. My other relatives laughed at me. --- Why would anyone want old books? Later, I found grandfather's money --- inside his books!\nAlan Murphy",

He learned how to live by himself on the island. He went into the woods. He cut down some small trees, and began to make a house. He planted a garden for food and used the skins (皮) of animals for clothes.\nOne day he looked in the distance (远处) and saw a group of people. Some natives (土人) had sailed to the island. They had a man with them. Robinson saved the man. He called the man Friday. He told him to live and work with him.\nMany years later, a ship stopped at the island. It was an English ship. The captain was surprised to find an Englishman here on the island.\n\"Well, we can help you,\" said the captain. \"We can take you back to England.\"\nRobinson told Friday to get on too. They sailed to a bigger island. The bigger island was Friday's home. Friday was happy to get home. But he was sad to leave his good friend. Then the ship sailed to England.

People from all over the world send the letters to Santa Claus in Finland. Everyone cleans their houses ready for the three holy (神圣) days of Christmas - Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day.\nThe most important day is Christmas Eve in Sweden. A special Christmas meal is eaten on Christmas Eve - ham, herring fish, and brown beans - and this is the time when families give presents to each other. Many people attend a church meeting early on Christmas Day.\nIn the days of the Soviet Union, Christmas was not celebrated very much. New Year was the important time - when \"Father Frost\" brought presents to children. Now Christmas can be openly celebrated - either on December 25th; or more often on January 7th. Special Christmas food includes cakes, pies and \"meat dumplings.\"\nIn France, everyone has a Christmas tree, sometimes decorated in the old way with red ribbons and real white candles. Fir trees in the garden are often decorated too, with lights on all night. Father Christmas is called Pere Noel. The Christmas meal is the important family gathering with good meat and the best wine. Not everyone sends Christmas cards.\nFather Christmas is called Papai Noel in Brazil. Many Christmas customs are similar to those in the USA or UK. For those who have enough money, a Christmas meal will be chicken, ham, rice, salad, pork, fresh fruit, often with beer. Poorer people will just have chicken and rice.",

Hopefully, you won' t find yourself making some of the same mistakes in your life that I've made in mine.\nAlways be honest, with others, hut most importantly, with yourself. Now, this is not to say you must always tell the absolute truth to everyone, all the time. Don' t use the truth as a weapon to hurt someone. Somebody who asks, \"Do you like my new jacket?\" doesn't want to hear that maybe you think it's terrible. They're proud of it and happy and just trying to show off a little. It's okay to say you like it if it makes them happy. But for the really important things in life you should always try to be as honest as you can be.\nHold on to your friends. Some friends you' II have for a lifetime, others will just seem to enter your life and pass on through. But every one of them is a treasure beyond measure. There will be times in your life when you'll need them, and good friends will do that for you. When a friend needs you, be there for them, help them and get them back on their feet again\nNever make a promise unless you are sure you can keep it, and then try your best to keep it .A man is often judged by how he keeps his word. People will pardon you for breaking a promise sometimes when it was given honestly but had to be broken for reasons beyond your control, just don't make a habit of it.\nLife is funny! Never be afraid to laugh about it. You're going to make mistakes and look silly at times, so always be willing to laugh at yourself. If you ever find yourself unable to laugh at your own mistakes you're taking yourself way too seriously and need to lighten up.\nNo matter how bad today is, or how terrible yesterday was, tomorrow is a new chance. Put a smile on your face and do what need to be done.\nIf it's silly but it works, it isn't silly. Don't be afraid to try something new or unusual.\nThere's a lot more to life than these things Daniel, and hopefully I' II be in your life for a long time to come to help you learn them.\nWith love, always,\nDad\n\n注:absolute 完全的 weapon 武器  beyond measure  难以估价的",

The little boy had the same disease before and had developed the antibodies(抗体)to fight the illness.\nThe doctor talked to her little boy about what they planned to do, and asked him if he would be willing(愿意的) to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate(迟疑) for a moment. He took a deep breath and said,\"Yes, I'll do it if it can save Lisa.\"\nAs the transfusion was going on, the little boy lay quietly in bed next to his sister.

I thought this tower was a place to buy pizza. It must be the best place to buy pizza in the world, I thought. Many years later I finally saw the Leaning Tower. I knew then that is was Pisa and no pizza. But there was still something special about it for me .The tower got its name because it really does lean to one side. Some people want to try to repair it. They are afraid it may fall over and they don't like it leans over the city.\nI do not think it's a good idea to try to repair it. The tower probably will not fall down. It is 600 years old. Why should anything happen to it now? And, if you ask me, I like what it looks like. Nothing is perfect*, it seems to say.\nAnd who cares? Why do people want things to be perfect? Imperfect things may be more interesting. The tower in Pisa is a good example. Why is it so famous? There are many other older, more beautiful towers in Italy. But Pisa tower is the most famous because it is quite different from others. People come from all over the world to see it.",

My husband and I lived in the middle of Horlton until two years ago----- a seaside town of nearly five thousand people. When my husband stopped working, we moved to our present house in a small village at the foot of Roland Hill, and there is no doubt that our costs are higher now.\nI have to do my shopping in small shops, where the food id more expensive than in city supermarkets; it costs more to travel by bus; and because the men who come to mend the television, or the washing-machine, have to come further, we have to pay them more.\nBut it does not cost us much to enjoy what is beautiful in the country; and peace and quiet are cheap. Many people spend a great deal of time money driving into the country to enjoy the simple things of life; yet we can enjoy them just by going out of the front door. It cost more to live here than it did in Horlton, but now life really is worth living.\nYours faithfully,\nTom",

With a modern airliner you can travel in one day to places which it took a month or more to get to a hundred years ago.\nTraveling by train is slower than by plane, but it has its advantages. You can see the country you are traveling through. Modern trains have comfortable seats and dining-cars. They make even the longest journey enjoyable.\nSome people prefer to travel by sea when possible. There are large liners and river boats. You can visit many other countries and different parts of your country on them. Ships are not so fast as trains or planes, but traveling by sea is very pleasant way to spend a holiday.\nMany people like to travel by car. You can make your own timetable. You can travel three or four hundred miles or only fifty or one hundred miles a day, just as you like. You can stop wherever you wish----- where there is something interesting to see, at good restaurant where you can enjoy a good meal, or at a hotel to spend the night. That is why traveling by car is popular for pleasure trips, while people usually take a train or plane when they are traveling on business.",

Read Test Directions(说明)Carefully Directions tell what you need to do. Words like best, always, only, all, and never will help you find the correct answer.\nSentences with those words are usually not true.\nDirections: Read each question. Circle the best answer.\n4. Which is the fastest way of traveling?\nA. By train B. By ship. C. By plane. D. By bus.\n2. Plan Your Time Pass over hard questions. If you have time, you can go back to them later.\n3. Read Items (题干)Again If you are not sure about an answer, read the item again. Think about all the answer choices. Which one seems best?\nSHORT-ANSWER TEST\nIn a short-answer test, write a word, a group of words, or a sentence to answer a question. Look for key words like who or what that tell you what to write in the answer.\n12. What do people have to take when they travel around?\n_Food, water and money._\nPASSAGE-WRITING TEST\nFor a passage-writing test, write one or more paragraphs to answer one question.\n1. Study the Item and Key Words Read the question two times or more. Look for key words that tell you exactly what to do. You might see prompts (提示)like these:\n・Discuss the problems in traveling.\n・Think of some ways to make it better.\n2. Plan Your Answer Think about the key words and the topic. Write everything you know about the topic on a piece of your own paper. This can help you organize (组织)your writing.\n3. Write the Passage Use the words in the prompts to write a beginning. Then use what you know about the topic to write your passage.\nWrite a topic sentence for each paragraph.\nWrite the important information in the body.\nRead your passage before you hand it in.\nYou may try these strategies in today's test. We hope you'll have a great success. Good luck!",

It was from several of his classmates asking him to join them on a camping trip (野营). This was the first time he was asked to join in an out-of-school activity(活动). Why were they asking him now? Nobody seemed to like him. In fact, he had been so lonely that he drowned his feeling with food. As a result, he had put on a lot of weight ( 体重), and this gave the kids something more to make fun of him.\nCindy, who was standing near Jess when he read the invitation, went out quickly to tell the others that the trick (诡计) had worked. Everyone was pleased that Jess thought that was true. But there was no camping trip. The whole thing was made up.\nAt first, Cindy thought it was fun. But later, when Jess told her that he was going to buy a sleeping bag with his savings, Cindy had second thoughts. She knew that Jess's family had little money, and she hated to see him spend his savings on something he would never use. Cindy also hated to tell Jess the truth. Her close friends would be angry with her. What could she do now?",

It was a cheap self-service place with long table and I went to get a cup of coffee.\nWhen I came back with the coffee, there was someone in the next seat. It was one of those wild-looking boys, with dark glasses and old clothes, and his hair was colored bright red at the front. What did surprise me was that he'd started to eat my chocolate.\nI was rather uneasy about him, but I didn't want to make more trouble. I just looked down at the front page of the newspaper, tasted my coffee and took a bit of chocolate. The boy looked at me closely. Then he took a second piece of chocolate. I could hardly believe it. Still I didn't say anything to him. When he took a third piece, I felt angrier. I thought, well, I shall have the last piece. \"And I got it.\"\nThe boy gave me a strange look, and then stood up. As he left he shouted out, \"There is something wrong with the woman,\" Everybody looked at me, but it was worse when I finished my coffee and got ready to leave. My face turned red when I knew I'd made a mistake. It wasn't my chocolate that I had eaten. There was mine, just under my newspaper.",

They say that the average (平均) person can learn two or three times as much during sleep as in the same period during the day -- and this does not affect his rest in any way. A word of warning, however, sleep-teaching will only force your head to learn what you have studied already while you are awake.\nIn one experiment, ten lessons were broadcast over the radio continually for two weeks. Each lesson lasted twelve hours -- from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. . The first three hours of English grammar and vocabulary were given with the student awake. At 11 p.m. a sleep song was broadcast to send the student to sleep and for the next three hours the radio whispered the lesson again into his sleeping ears. At 2 a.m. a sharp noise was sent over the radio to wake the sleeping student up for a few minutes to review the lesson. Then soft songs went him back to rest again while the radio went on. At 5 o'clock his sleep ended and he had to go through the lesson again for three hours before breakfast.",

He will tell you who he expects to win such and such a match, and his opinion is usually as good as that of men three of four times his age.\nMost schools in England take football seriously -- much more seriously than nearly all European schools, where lessons are all that are important, and games are left for the children themselves. In England, it is believed that education is not only a matter of filling a boy's mind with facts in the classroom, education also means the training of character, and one of the best ways of training character is by means of games, especially team games, where the boy or girl has to learn to work with others for his team, instead of working for himself alone. The school, therefore, plans games and matches for its pupils. Football is a good team game, good both for the body and the mind. That is why it is every school's game in England. (217)",

This book is a journal I wrote last month for a very special competition. I won the first prize, which was that my book would become part of the first ever experiment in time travel. It would be put in a timecapsuleto be sent back almost fifty years into the past. So, if everything went according to plan, you should be reading this in about the year 2005.\nDo you know what timecapsulesare? They are usually containers made of some very strong material so strong that it should last for hundreds or thousands of years without being destroyed. Inside these containers, you put things that are typical of the place in which you live. For example, in 2005 you might put a copy of a popular comic, a CD by a famous musician, videos of television programmes all sorts of things. The idea is that when people in another century open up the time capsule. They'll be able to see what life was like in the past.\nUntil now, all timecapsuleshave been left for people in the future to find. This one is the first that has been sent from the future to the past. I don't understand how it's going to be done, but I think it's a really cool idea. If it works, my own grandparents will be able to read this when they were secondary school students!But if my grandparents did read this, why haven't they ever mentioned it to me?",

I finally left at about 11 p.m. I drove home slowly because the weather was terrible~the wind was blowing and it was raining heavily. I was turning into our road when a man suddenly ran in front of my car. I almost hit him but I stopped just in time. I was frightened and the man looked frightened too, I got out of the car but he ran away before I could ask if he was all right. It was very strange.\nWhen I got home, the lights were on but it was very quiet. I called to my wife but there was no answer. Then I remembered that she was out at a concert.\nI was still very upset about what happened on the road,sol made myself a drink. Then I went upstairs to have a bath. I saw that the window in the bedroom was open. This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out. She,was afraid of burglars(夜盗者). When I went to close it,I found Ellen. She was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere. I rushed over and felt for her pulse but she was dead. I sat on the floor beside her body and was too frightened to do anything.\nThe next thing I knew, the sky was getting light. I can' t remember a thing about that night. In the morning I phoned the police. They arrived about half an hour after I phoned them. But it seemed like hours. During that time I tried hard to remember anything I could about the night before. I couldn't stop thinking about the man in the road. What was he doing at that time of night in our quiet neighbourhood? Why did he look so frightened? Why did he run away?",

When an animal was killed, they made use of its skins to cover their bodies. The skins kept them warm.\nNature is people's good friend. It once helped people find fire, when lightning hit a forest and started a fire. People took some of this fire to their homes. The fire kept them warm, and also frightened wild animals. Soon people found the food cooked tasted much better, so they began to use the fire to cook food.\nBut people still didn't know how to make a fire. When they got a fire from the forest they tried to keep it burning. If it went ort, they had to wait for years.\nBut later they found different ways to make fire. For example, they made fire by burning wood or knocking two pieces of stones.\nToday it's easy for people to make fire because they have matches, lighters and different kinds of heaters. They can make fire at any time they need.",

I live just down the road.\"\nHe was looking at our things: first at the flowers, then at the bookshelf.\n\"Well, well,\" he said and laughed, \"It's a bookshelf you've got there!

They usually throw food to them, and don't think about at all whether the food is right or not. Some of the peacocks became ill, some even died after eating the bad food given by the visitors.\nI'm sure most of the visitors who throw food to the peacocks really like the birds, but don't realize that they may be doing them harm.\nThe visitors should be told that what they have done is very harmful to the birds, and this kind of thing must be stopped from happening.\nPerhaps we can build some small shops beside Dongfeng Square to sell peacock food. For us every person, it is our duty to give more love to these beautiful birds and to look after them carefully.\nYours,\nSun Yan",

They walk in the snow and they get food from the sea in the middle of the dark Antarctic(南极的) water. They choose their wives in the dark. They can only hear them---not see them. Then the female(雌的) penguins lay their eggs and go away for about two months. The males look after the eggs. If the eggs get cold, there will be no chicks(雏企鹅). There is no food. The snow falls and the wind blows---sometimes at 150 kilometers an hour. When the females return from the sea, they will not remember their husbands. It does not matter. Only one thing matters---the eggs. Male penguins never fight---unless a penguin leaves a chick for a minute. Then they fight because they all want it. They are strange and wonderful birds.",

In the early 1980s \"Where is the beef?\" was one of the most popular expressions in the United States. It seemed as if everyone was using it at the time.\nBeef, of course, is the meat for a cow, and no food is more popular in American than a hamburger made from beef.

Ray Kroc became one of the richest businessmen in America.\nOther business people watched his success. Some of them opened their own hamburger restaurants. One company called \"Wendy' s\" said its hamburgers are bigger than those sold by McDonald's or anyone else. The Wendy's company begin to use the expression \"Where's the beef?\" to make people know that Wendy's hamburgers were the biggest. The Wendy's television advertisement showed there old women eating hamburgers. The bread that covered the meat was very big, but inside there was only a bit of meat. One of the women said she would not eat a hamburger with such a little piece of beef. \"Where's the beef?' she shouted in a funny way.

When you want to dress in a modern way, your mum doesn't like you wearing a mini-skirt. When you are making phone calls to friends, they ask if you're speaking to a boy or a girl. Sometimes it seems that you' re not as close to your parents as you used to be. How can you become close again?\n\"Closing the Gap\" by American author Jay McGraw gives advice on how to have a better relationship (关系) with your parents. He gives ways to help you under­stand your parents. When you think \"my parents don't want me to have any fun\", that usually means your parents want you to be safe. Both parents and children have needs. They need to feel they are important and loved.\nYou should tell your parents your needs, and find out what their needs are. Then you can think of a way to make all of you happy. He gives you some ideas:\n1. Make time to talk. You could talk about your school life and your plans for the future.\n2. Keep a diary. This is to help you understand more about yourself and your feelings.\n3. Show your parents you are growing up. Wash your own clothes and help around the house.\nYour parents will feel that you are no longer a small child.If you follow these steps, slowly, you will be able to break down the walls between your parents and yourself.",

There are, besides the front page with the most important news, the sports news, the amusements (娱乐) page, a business page, and so on.",

A student collected in the papers when the exam ended.\n\"That test was not only a test of knowledge, but also a test of moral (道德). We wanted to show students how important honesty (诚实) is,\" said Cai Wenguo , the school's headmaster. The school says no cheating (作弊)happened in the test. Next year, it wants 80% of its exams to be without teachers. But students have different ideas.\n\"I was happy and excited during the exam because my teachers trusted (信任) me,\" said Lang Yudan, a 13-year-old girl in Class 11.\n\"Schools must trust students a lot not to use invigilators (监考人). But I think it is too early. Some students will cheat if there are no invigilators. And the students will not be able to ask for help when needed, 99 said Hua Sha.\n\"I don' t like having invigilators in exams. When they walk around the classroom, they make me nervous. I would get higher marks without them in the room because I would feel more relaxed,\" Liu Qingxi said.\n\"I think it's very important to have invigilators in exams. Many students want to check their answers with each other after they have finished papers. And they can also keep the classroom in order when something unusual happens. They may make me nervous, but I still think we need them,\" Shangguan Yuan said.\nNot using invigilators may be a good idea. But before using it, schools must tell students the importance of honesty and try to find ways to solve something unusual in exams.",

He was 67 years old and in bad health. He got only $493 a month. He said that he saw the bag on a street corner and found the money and the ticket in the top part of the bag. He changed the money into money order and spent his own money to send it to Japan.\nMr. Tadatoyo Yamamoto was very moved by what Mr. Loveras had done. \"I asked him why he would go to all the trouble to return everything to me.

But every time the old man would try his best to show that the lie might have been true in some ways. He always said, \" It's not a good lie. I would not give my daughter to you.\"\nOne day a young man came to the old man. The young man took out an old piece of paper from his handbag and said, \" Your father borrowed one million dollars from my grandpa before he died. He wrote this for my grandpa and told us to take back the money from you.\"\nThe old man looked at the piece of paper and on it he could see some words: \"Dear Mr Blien. I have borrowed one million dollars from you but I'm not able to pay it back. Ask my son or my grandson to pay you the money some day after my death.\"\nNow the old man didn't know what to do. \" If I say it's a lie, I must give him my daughter,\" he thought to himself. \" But if I say it's not a lie, I must pay him the money.\"\nIn the end he said, \" It's a lie, a well-made lie.\" So the young man married the old man's daughter.",

For hundreds of years, men have wanted to travel to the moon. When they looked at the moon , they asked many questions. Was the moon hot or cold? Were there any plants or living things there? There were many, many other questions. Some people said there were living plants on the moon. Others said nothing could live there because there was no air or water on the moon. We know much more about the moon now. Scientists have studied the moon for many years and have found out many facts. Not long ago, spaceships with men in them flew to the moon. What do we know about the moon? We find that the moon is much smaller than the earth. It is about one quarter the size of the earth. It is traveling round the earth all the time . Days and nights on the moon are very long . One day on the moon is as long as two weeks on the earth. One night is also as long as two weeks on the earth. In the day the moon is very hot . At night , it is very cold. The moon is much hotter and much colder than the earth. There is another surprising thing. On the moon things are not as heavy as they are on the earth.

These words show the friendship between people and animals. Dogs and other pets can give joy to people's lives. Some people think of their pets as their children. A few even leave all their money to their pets when they die!\nAnimals can help people, too. Dogs can be taught to be the \"eyes\" for a blind person or \"ears\" for a deaf person. Scientists have found that pets help people live longer! They make people happier, too. Because of that, animals are brought into hospitals for \"visits\".\nAmericans hold \"Be Kind to Animals Week\" the first week of May. Pet shows are held during the week. Even if you don't live in America, you, too, can do this. How? First, think about how animals make your life richer. If you have a pet, take more time this week to play with it. Remember to give it delicious food.\nIf you don't have a pet, be kind to animals around you. For example, if you see a street dog, don't kick it or throw things at it. Instead, just leave it alone, or better yet, make friends with it. If others around you do bad things to an animal, try to speak up. As people, we must protect animals who can't speak for themselves.",

Many Americans think that it is the national sport.\nBaseball is played by two teams of nine men each. Different men have different jobs when the team is on the field. Each team must try to score more points than the other team. A point is scored when one man hits the ball and then runs around the playing field to each of the four bases(垒).\nThe men who play baseball must do two things well. First, they must hit the ball when it is their turn. If they can hit the ball well, they can help their team to win the game. Second, they must catch and throw the ball well. When their team is on the field, they can keep the other team from winning. These are the two abilities that a baseball player must have.\nOf course, there are some good things about baseball. You don't have to be very intelligent(有才智的) to play baseball or to watch it. You can easily understand what is happening on the field. Many Americans enjoy going to a baseball game during the summer months. The weather is warm and usually sunny, and it is a pleasure to sit outside for a few hours and watch a game. Baseball games do not usually cost much money. You can go to a baseball game for a very small amount of money, and still have a very good time.",

He stopped to look at the front row of shoes, and he felt sorry for himself. He really wanted to have a new pair for his birthday. He sadly walked away and thought of what to tell his mother. He knew she would give him anything if she could. But he also knew very well she had little money. He decided not to go home at once, because he looked worried and he didn't want to make his mother worry about it. So he went to the park and there he sat on the grass. Then he saw a girl in a wheel chair. He found that the girl moved the wheels with her hands. Bill looked at her carefully and was surprised to see that the girl had no feet. He looked down at his won feet. \"It is much better to be without shoes than without feet.\" He thought. It was not right for him to feel so sorry and sad.

Most pages have words, pictures and even sound or music.\nWhat is e-mail?\nElectronic mail (e-mail ) is a way of sending messages to other people. It's much quicker and cheaper than sending a letter.\nIf you want to use e-mail,you must have an e-mail address. This address must have letters and dots(点) and an '@' ( meaning 'at').
