I went for a walk in Hyde Park but Jenny didn't come with me because she was tired.\nThen on Tuesday we saw the clock, Big Ben, and Buckingham Palace. Queen Elizabeth lives in the Palace, but we didn't see her! I bought some presents but Jenny didn't buy anything!\nThe next day we visited the British Museum and had dinner in a Chinese restaurant!\nOn Thursday morning we relaxed. Then we went to Tower Bridge on the River Thames and looked at the city. It's very big!\nFinally today I did some shopping and Jenny listened to a concert in the park. I came back to the hotel and read the newspaper. Then I wrote some postcards and sent some emails. I took lots of photos and I'm sending them with this e-mail to you!\nTomorrow we're going to fly home. It was a short holiday, but it was great! Say hello to Mum and Dad.\nLove,\nGran",

That was not very bad in summer, but in winter it was cold. And we didn't have any hot water in the house. We had to wash in cold water. We didn't have a bathroom . My dad had some chickens. I had to feed them every morning and then I had to walk to school with my little sister. It was about two miles to school and about two miles back in the evening. But it always seemed longer in the morning when we were going to school. There was a bus, but we didn't have any money. And we had to go to bed at eleven o'clock every night because I had too much homework and housework to do. We couldn't watch TV because there wasn't any. On Sundays we had to go to church three times �C morning, afternoon and evening. And we couldn't play outside on Sundays. But it wasn't all bad. We had some good times . We could go out and our parents didn't have to worry about us. There weren't so many cars on the roads then, so the streets were safe to play in. And there were not many robbers and thieves in those days. We had to work hard and we weren't able to buy all those things in the shops today. Life was hard, but it was simple and people were happier. I don't think I'd like to be young today.",

During this time the streets of the city are alive(具有活力的) with music and dance from early morning until late at night. You can even see artists painting pictures on the streets. One of the best parts of the Festival is the \"Fringe\", where students do comedy shows in small halls and cafés.\nTens of thousands of tourists come to the Festival to see new films and plays and hear music played by famous musicians. This year, you can see over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries.\nThe tickets for these performances are quite cheap and it is usually easier to see your favourite star in Edinburgh than it is in London.

It is difficult to say how many people are learning it. Millions of boys and girls are trying to do so. Many English children study French. French is also a very important language. Some children study German, Russian, Japanese and Chinese.\nWhich is the best way to learn a language? We know that we all learnt our own language well when we were children. If we learn a second language in the same way, it won't seem so difficult. How does a small child do? He listens to what people say, and he tries to guess what he hears. When he wants something, he has to ask for it. He is using the language, thinking it and talking it all the time. If people use a second language all the time, they will learn it quickly.",

I know a lot of people think it is wrong to keep animals in zoos. However(然而), I think that zoos have many good points(优点). First, zoos are places for people to see many different kinds of animals from all over the world. Without zoos, most people would never see a real bear or tiger. Second, zoos look after the animals very well. The animals are always given food and cleaned regularly(定期地). In the wild, it is not always possible for an animal to find food, so sometimes it goes hungry. But animals that are kept in zoos never go hungry. Third, zoos protect the animals they look after. They give them safe places to live in. In the wild, some kinds of animals are in danger (危险)of becoming extinct. But zoos give these animals a chance to live. Without zoos, there would be fewer kinds of animals in the world. Maria Smith Zoos are unnatural in Maria's letter, she says that zoos are good for animals. But I don't think that zoos are good for animals, they are only good for people. It is unnatural(非自然的)to keep wild animals in cages. Most animals are kept in cages that are too small for them. In the wild, these animals would travel freely. In zoos, they can't do this. This is why the bears and tigers look so sad. Most cages are not very clean either. It is true that zoos give the animals food regularly, but this is not natural. Wild animals are used to (习惯于)looking for their own food. Would anyone be happy if you don't let him go outside his home? Would Maria like to have lots of people standing outside her apartment looking at her? No, she wouldn't. And animals don't like it either. Philip Black.",

And so a short answer was often given. In the northern part of Greece there was a land called Macedon. And this land at one time was ruled by a war-like king named Philip. He wanted to become the king of all Greece. So he made war on others, until nearly all of them were made to call him their king. Then he sent a letter to the Spartans in Laconia, saying, \"If I go down into your country, I'll level your great city to the ground.\" In a few days an answer was brought to him. When he opened the letter, he found only one word written there. The word was: \"If\". It was as much as to say, \"We are not afraid of you as long as the word 'if' stands in your way.\"",

They went for a picnic yesterday but I didn't go with them, because I hurt my foot and I couldn't walk very well.

Maybe I will find a treatment for cancer( 癌症). I will be famous and I will be very rich.\nAfter I become a very successful doctor, I will get married. I want to marry an interesting person. For example, my wife might be an artist. We will have a womderful life together. I think we will have one or two children. Doctors get paid quite a lot so I think we will have a nice house.

Cable television can help people receive TV programs that they can not get with theirordinary(常规) antenna.\nTelevisionsignals(信号) travel in straight lines in all directions. Signals from a TV station move towards thehorizon(地平线) and then go into space. If people live only a few miles from a TV station, they may get a good picture on their televisions. But if they live more than 50 miles from a station, they may not get good pictures.\nCATV began in 1948. People in places far from TV stations had to pay for it. A community antenna was usually placed on a hill, a mountain or on a high tower. The antenna can receive TV signals and send them into a smalllocalstation(当地电视台).\nToday, cable television is used in more and more areas. It is even used in many classrooms all over the country.",
