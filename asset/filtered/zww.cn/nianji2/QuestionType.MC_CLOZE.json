Some collections are worth a lot of money, others arevaluable(有价值的)only 5<blank> their owners.\nI know a man who has a coin collection worth several 6<blank> dollars. A short time ago he bought arare(罕见的)fifty-cent piece which 7<blank> him $ 250! On the other hand, my youngest brother collects match boxes. He has almost 600 of them, but I wonder 8<blank> they are worth any money. 9<blank>, to my brother they are quite valuable. Nothing makes him 10<blank> than to find a new match box for his collection.\nThat's what a hobby means, I think. It is something we like to do in our free time just for the fun of it.",
