So she asked our five-year-old daughter, Kathy, to buy some. \"Here's a dollar,\" my wife said, \" get two loaves(条) of bread, if they have it. If they don't have it, get anything. But hurry!\" Kathy hurried off, and we waited and waited. By a quarter past six, all the friends had arrived. But Kathy had not returned. Finally we saw her dancing around the corner with a bright new hula hoop(呼啦圈) whirling(旋转) round her middle. \"Kathy!\" her mother cried. \"Where did you get that hula hoop, and where is the bread?\" \"Well, when I got to the shop, they had sold all their bread,\" answered Kathy. \"And you said 'If they don't have that, get anything!'\"",

            "context": "Zidane was born in Marseilles in the south of France in 1972. His parents were Algerian (阿尔及利亚人) and had moved to France in the 1950s. In 1989 at the age of 17 he joined Cannes football club. After three years he moved to Bordeaux in 1992 and was voted (被选为) \"Young Player of the Year\". In the same year he played in his first international match for France against the Czech Republic (捷克共和国). (1) He rescued (解救) the French team from disaster by scoring two goals near the end of the match. The final (决赛) score was 2 : 2.\nIn 1996 he moved to Italy to join Turin's team Juventus. He has played in three European Cup finals, twice for Juventus and once for Bordeaux. However, (2) he was not in any of the winning teams and did not play at his best in the three finals. Reporters describe him as one of the best midfield players (中锋) in the world. He can turn fast, he can run past the opposing team. (3) He can kick a ball onto just the right place for a team member to score. In his 33 games for France before the World Cup, he scored 10 goals.\nZidane is the hero of North African people who are living in France. These people have not had an easy life in the past. They are among the poorest of the country and find it hard to get jobs.\nBut the French team has at last shown the public that French people come from all over the world. Out of the 11 players, four were morn outside mainland France. Six other were born in France to non �C French parents. \"France's win and (4) Zidane's playing has brought all French people together,\" said one reporter.\nIn the World Cup in 1998, Zidane played well against Saudi Arabia, but was sent off the pitch by the referee (裁判). (He stood on a Saudi Arabian player who had fallen over.) In the semi �C final against Croatia, (5) he was still not at his best. When the day of the match came, France's fans were rewarded. Zidane scored two out of France's three goals and was voted European Football of the Year. The President (总统) of France said on TV, \"We're happy and that's the least I can say. It's the best day of my life.\"",

They know that they are in danger. The rabbit has told them something without making a sound. It has given them a signal.\nMany other animals use this kind of \"language\". When a cobra is angry, it raises its head and makes itself look fierce. This warns other animals. When a bee has found food, it goes back to its home. It cannot \"tell\" the other bees where the food is by speaking to them, but it does a little dance. This tells the bees where the food is.\nSome animals \"say\" things by making sound. A dog barks, for example, when a stranger comes near. A cat purrs when it is pleased. Some birds make several different sounds, each with its own meaning. Sometimes we human beings speak in the same way. We make sound like \"Oh\" or \"Ah\" when we are frightened or pleased or when we drop something on our toes.",

They sometimes eat raw(生的)fish. In Africa, maize(玉米)is the most important food. People there make maize into flour(面粉).From this flour they make different kinds of bread and cakes.\nIn western(西方的)countries such as Britain, Australia and the U.S.A, the most important food is bread or potatoes. People there usually make their bread from wheat flour. They cook the potatoes in different ways. In England the most popular food is fish and chips. Sometimes people cook this food at home, but usually they buy it at the shop. They eat this food at home, in their work place, in the park or on the road. People call it \"take-away\" food.",

How to find it in the dictionary both quickly and correctly?\nFirst, all the English words are arranged(安排) in the letter order. In the dictionary you can first see the words beginning with letter A, then B, C, D…. That means, if there are two words \"desert\" and \"pull\", \"desert\" will be certainly before \"pull\". Then if there are two words both beginning with the same letter, you may look at the second letter. Then the third, the fourth… For example, \"pardon\" is before \"plough\", \"judge\" before \"just\", etc.\nDo you understand how to look up in the dictionary?\nThe dictionary will be your good friend.

It can teach them something about the language of today's kids.\nSo lots of people, young and old, went to see the book's author, 19-year-old Korean girl Guiyeoni, on Saturday. She was in Beijing to sign books for her fans.\n\"Guiyeoni wrote a story that is near to us and goes to our hearts,\" said a Junior 2 student in Beijing. \"When I read it, I laughed and I cried.\"\nLike the \"Meteor Garden\" TV series, \"That Guy Was Cool\" tells an unusual story of love between two students. The girl is sweet, but she's just average(一般的). The boy is good-looking and has everything, but he is often unhappy because his father died when he was very young. They become close and help each other to be happy. In the end, they fall in love.\n\"The girl in the book is like me. She's simple and moody,\" said Guiyeoni.\nGuiyeoni's book doesn't only use words. It also uses things like emotions. Emotions are small icons, like smiling faces, and they are used to show emotions. Kids know what these things mean, because they often use them when they talk on the Internet or send messages with mobile phones.\nGuiyeoni said she wrote this way because of her young readers. \"Writing with pictures is vivid(生动)and can say a lot of things,\" she said.\nGuiyeoni began writing the book's story on the Web in 2001 when she was a Senior 2 (高二)student. Last year, she put that online story together to make this book. \"That Guy Was Cool\" has been made into a film, and it will come out in Korea next month.\nThis is Guiyeoni's first of four books, and she hopes to keep writing as she goes through college.\nShe also has a message for young writers. \"I think that if they try hard, lots of young people can do this.\"",

For example, if your address is 73 Lemon Street, you would write down 73. Next, double it. In other words, multiply(乘) it by two. Then, add five to this doubled number. For example, if your address is 73 and you have doubled it, you will get 146. Then, if you added five, you'd get 151. So, to repeat the first three steps, write down your house number, double it, and add five. Fourth, multiply this number by 50. In our example here, if you multiply 151 by 50, you'll get 7550. The fifth step is to add your age to this total. For example, if you're 26 years old, you should add 26 to this total. In our example here, the result would be 7550 plus 26, you'll get 7576. Sixth, you have to add the number of days in a year, which is 365. In our example here, 365 added to 7576 is 7941. The seventh and final step is this: subtract(减) 615 from the number that you have. In our example, 7941 minus(减) 615 is 7326. The result here, 7-3-2-6, is the trick. The first part of the number is the address and the last part of the number is the age of the person. That is, 73 is the address that we started with, and 26 is the age that we used. If you follow these seven steps with any address and the age of any person. You will get the same result.",

Most students are always being told by their parents to study harder so that they can have a wonderful life. Though this may be a good idea for those very smart students, it can have terrible results for many students because they are not talented enough.\nAs it is reported, a number of students killed themselves. Others try to get the feelings of taking drugs(毒品). Some join the groups of troublemakers and turn to crime(犯罪). Many of them have tried very hard at school but have failed in the exams and have their parents lose hopes. Such students felt that they are hated by everyone else they meet and they don't want to go to school any longer.\nIt is surprising that though most Japanese parents are worried about their children, they do not help them in any ways .Many parents feel that they are not able to help their children and it is the teachers' work to help their children. To make matter worse, a lot of parents send their children to those school opening in the evenings and on weekends― they only help students to pass exams and never teach students any real sense of the world. It is a great surprise that almost three quarters of middle school students have been to such kind of schools. Many Japanese schools usually have rules about everything from the students' hair to their clothes and the things in their bags. Child psychologists (儿童心理学家)now think that such strict rules are harmful (有害的)to the feelings of the students. Almost 40% of the students said that no one had taught them how to get on with others, how to tell right from wrong, how to show love for others, even for their parents.",

Like thousands of students \" early birds\" in China, he has to get up before six every morning.\nA report shows that without a good night's sleep, students seem to be weaker (虚弱)than they should be. Many students have fallen asleep during class at one time or another. Too much homework is not the only reason why students stay up late.

This communication is very important in children's growing up, because friends can discuss important things.

Children can learn a lot from TV in a short time without going out. Many parents are happy about this because they themselves are too busy to spend time with their children.\nBut we have found that more and more children today have problems with reading, thinking, and concentrating even though they have watched a lot of TV. In fact, getting much information from TV does not mean real learning. Children who watch too much TV do not have enough time to think or to communicate with people. Besides, it takes time and love for children to grow up. What children need most are their parents. Parents give children love, and help them solve problems in the right way.

With the help of a person, a computer can draw pictures, write music, talk with people, play chess, recognise (辨认) voices,translate (翻译) languages and so on. Perhaps computers will one day really think and feel. Do you think that people will be afraid when they find that the computer is too clever to listen to and serve the people?",

Do not feel surprised, however, when they stretch their hands out in front of you after they have helped you. They just hope you can give them a little money as a tip. After you have given them the money, they will wave their hands to say good-bys.\nBelieve it or not, these monkeys are graduates of the School for Monkeys in India, where they were trained for one year. These monkey students are not the only ones in the world. Some monkeys are now being trained as nurses in an American medical college, These monkeys, after they have graduated from the school, are expected to look after patients who are bad ridden and help get the things they need from their homes.",

It is not because a person has money or good looks. A good friend should be kind and patient(耐心的). For example, if you have a bad day, a good friend should listen to your complaints(抱怨) and do his or her best to help. To make a friend, you cannot be too shy(害羞). You should make each other happy and share your lives.\nBut things cannot always be happy. Even the best friends have fights(打架). What should you do when you have a fight with your friend? You have to talk to him or her. When there is no one around, have an honest talk. If he or she doesn't want to talk, you could write a letter.\nThere are three steps(步骤) to being friends again:\nTell him or her how you are feeling; say what your friend has done wrong, and explain(解释) why you did this or that.

In the middle of the trip it began to rain. The roads became very wet and it was difficult to drive. We arrived home just after midnight, feeling very tired. The next morning it was still raining. James took his car to the local garage(汽车修理站) which was very good.\n\nIn the afternoon the weather improved. We wanted to go for a drive. My parents lent us their car. That was no good. Their car didn't work! We rang the garage. \"Oh, no.\" they said, \"your car won't be ready till tomorrow.\" So it wasn't possible to go for a drive. We decided to play a word game. When we didn't agree about a word we looked for a dictionary. It wasn't there. Suddenly my mother remembered. \"I lent it to your sister. She took it with her when she left.\" The word game wasn't any good without a dictionary.\n\nOn Sunday my mother dropped a suitcase on her foot and we had to hire a taxi to take her to hospital. When James and I drove back we got stuck in a traffic jam (交通阻塞). Next time I want to have a rest. I'll stay in the city!",

To accept a dish was by saying, \"Yes, please.\" To decline it was by saying, \"No, thanks.\" When eating they made little noise.\nAfter dinner he went upstairs to change his clothes. But he didn't come back. After a while I went upstairs and found him in bed asleep. That was his habit.\nHabits are very strong. If a man by habit saying, \"thank you\" and \"please\", it is easy for him to be polite. If a man smokes a great deal, it becomes very difficult for him to stop. A language is also made of habits. So we should form good habits of reading and speaking English.",

In 1989 at the age of 17 he joined Cannes football club. After three years he moved to Bordeaux in 1992 and was voted (被选为) \"Young Player of the Year\". In the same year he played in his first international match for France against the Czech Republic (捷克共和国). (1) He rescued (解救) the French team from disaster by scoring two goals near the end of the match. The final (决赛) score was 2 : 2.\nIn 1996 he moved to Italy to join Turin's team Juventus. He has played in three European Cup finals, twice for Juventus and once for Bordeaux. However, (2) he was not in any of the winning teams and did not play at his best in the three finals. Reporters describe him as one of the best midfield players (中锋) in the world. He can turn fast, he can run past the opposing team. (3) He can kick a ball onto just the right place for a team member to score. In his 33 games for France before the World Cup, he scored 10 goals.\nZidane is the hero of North African people who are living in France. These people have not had an easy life in the past. They are among the poorest of the country and find it hard to get jobs.\nBut the French team has at last shown the public that French people come from all over the world. Out of the 11 players, four were morn outside mainland France. Six other were born in France to non �C French parents. \"France's win and (4) Zidane's playing has brought all French people together,\" said one reporter.\nIn the World Cup in 1998, Zidane played well against Saudi Arabia, but was sent off the pitch by the referee (裁判). (He stood on a Saudi Arabian player who had fallen over.) In the semi �C final against Croatia, (5) he was still not at his best. When the day of the match came, France's fans were rewarded. Zidane scored two out of France's three goals and was voted European Football of the Year. The President (总统) of France said on TV, \"We're happy and that's the least I can say. It's the best day of my life.\"",

Mobile phone use among children has become a problem for the school this year. Several children have got mobile phones as Christmas gifts, and more students will want them. Mary Bluett, an official, said mobile phone use is a distraction (分心的事) to students during school hours and it also gives teachers so much trouble in their classrooms. Teachers were also saying that sometimes students might use phone messages to_cheat_during exams. She said some schools had tried to ban mobile phones. Some parents felt unhappy because they couldn't get in touch with their children. Many teachers said students should not have mobile phones at school, but if there was a good reason, they could leave their phones at school office. They also said there were many reasons why the students should not have mobile phones at school: they were easy to lose and were a distraction from studies. Many people say that they understand why parents would want their children to have phones, but they think schools should let the students know when they can use their mobile phones.",

But they shake hands after they haven't met for a long time or when they will be away from each other for a long time.\nLast year a group of German students went to England for a holiday. Their teacher told them that the English people hardly shake hands. So when they met their English friends at the station, they kept their hands behind their backs. The English students had learned that the Germans shake hands as often as possible, so they put their hands in front and got ready to shake hands with them. It made both of them laugh.",

I sent my first e-mail to Liu Hai last night. I failed to reach him by phone, so I wrote him a message . Then I waited to see if he would write back. To my pleasure, this morning I received an answer from him.\nNow I know that the internet is so funny and useful. I feel like I'm connected to everybody in the world. If I want to learn about somebody in the USA,I can use the internet. If I need any information, I can use the internet, too. I can look at the mountains in South America, or see fish far in the ocean. I can send a message to you in England , and you receive it in a moment\nI would love to get some e-mails from somebody in England.

After his run, he went to the hospital center. The nurse was surprised and pleased to see his blood pressure was 139 over 84. She told him that his blood pressure was very good. Then she said, \"I wish mine were that good.\" Johnny Kelly is known as the great grandfather of the Boston Marathon. He ran all the 42 kilometres of the marathon 61 times. This year was the second time that he has cut back and run only part of it. Kelley holds the record for running more Boston Marathon than anyone else. Thousands of people cry \"come on\" to him as he runs. Today an 11-year-old boy called out to Kelley, \"Hey, Mr Kelley--- you are great. Great man.\" Kelley smiles and thanks people as he runs. \"It's wonderful,\" he said. \"People come out to shake my hand. I am welcomed by thousands and thousands. I think a lot of them thought I ran the whole race. And maybe they congratulated me because they know me after all these years and they don't know the other runners.\"",

So a new network system(系统) had to be set up. It should be good enough to be used by many different computers. If part of the network was not working, information could be sent through another part. In this way the computer network system would keep on working all the time.\nAt first, the Internet was only used by the government, but, in the early 1970s, universities, hospitals and banks were allowed to use it too. However, computers were still expensive and the Internet was difficult to use. By the start of the 1990s, computers become cheaper and easier to use. Scientists had also developed software(软件) that made \"surfing(浏览)\" the Internet more conveninent(方便).\nToday it is easy to get on-line and it is said that millions of people use the Internet every day.

Everybody learns his own language by(通过)remembering what he hears when he is a small child. Some people don't live in their own country, and they seem to learn two languages almost as easily as one.

But still some people don't know when country music began.\nCountry music is from the folk music (民间音乐)of the Appalachian Mountains in the east of America. There, people sang while playing the violin and guitar. They sang about everyday life, love and their problems. So the songs were sometimes a little sad.\nOne of the most popular country music singers is John Denver, who is also quite famous to the Chinese. For Denver, music was a language that could bring the world together. He says music can bring people together. We will understand(理解) each other better through(通过) music. People are different in colour and they may speak different languages, but people are the same in mind and body(在心灵和精神方面). All of them love music and can understand music.\nThe world lost a great man when John Denver died in 1997. But his music and words will live on.",

You said \"Happy Spring Festival!\" so it is spring in China now! Here in Australia it is nearly autumn, his beginning to get colder. But it never gets really cold here.\"You asked me when it was the best time to go to Australia. Australians will tell you anytime is a good time! Many people think the best time is in summer. It gets very hot at that time of year. Some people say it gets too hot. But I like summer best.\"In summer I go swimming in the sea nearly every day. It's great. Swimming is very popular in Australia. The sea is very blue and very beautiful. Some people swim in the sea all the year round. But I don't swim in July and August. I think the sea is too cold.\"All the best,\"John",

Some Chinese parents are usually glad to see their children studying late. They will think their children work very hard, but not all parents are happy about this. Once a mother told us tat every morning her 10-year-old boy put up one finger (手指)with his eyes still closed, begging(请求) for one more minute to sleep. Like thousands of students \" early birds\" in China, he has to get up before six every morning.A report shows that without a good night's sleep, students seem to be weaker (虚弱)than they should be. Many students have fallen asleep during class at one time or another. Too much homework is not the only reason why students stay up late. Some watch TV or play the computer games late into the night.Experts have ever said that the students should develop good study habits. So some clever students never study last, they are able to work well in class.",

People always laughed at him. No one showed kindness to him.\nHis only friend was a dog named Tigc. He gave his dog enough to eat and drink, but sometimes he was not polite to it. He didn't know that an unkind word sometimes could cut one's heart like a knife.\nOne day as he walked down the street, a young lady was walking in front of him. Suddenly one of her bags dropped from her arms. As she stopped to pick it up, she dropped other bags. He came to help her. \"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy!\" she said kindly, smiling.\nA special feeling came to him. These were the first kind words he had ever heard. He watched her until she went far away, and then he whistled (吹口哨) to his dog and went directly to the river nearby.\n\"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy!\" He repeated (重复) the woman's words. Then in a low voice he said to his dog, \"You ate a nice little dog!\" Tige raised its ears as if it understood.\n\"Uhum! Even a dog likes it!\" he said. \"Well, Tige, I won't say unkind words to you any more.\" Tige waved its tail happily.\nThe boy thought and thought. Finally he looked at himself in the river. He saw nothing but a dirty boy. He washed his face carefully. Again he looked. He saw a clean nice boy. He was amazed. From then on, he had a new life.\nAfter telling this, the businessman stopped for a while, and then he said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the very pace where that kind woman planted in me the first seed (种子) of kindness. All of us should learn about kindness. What a great power (力量) it has!\"",

They also listen to the news about sports, the weather, and the life of American people. Most of the radio programs are music.\nPop or popular music singers make much money. They make a CD or tape which radio stations use in many places. Once the popular singer is heard all over the country, young people buy his or her tapes. Some of the money from these tapes goes to the singer. Wherever the singer goes, all the young people want to meet him or her. Now the singer has become a national (国家的) star.\nThere are other kinds of music that are important to Americans. One is called folk (民间) music. It tells stories about the common life of Americans. Another is called western or country music. This was started by cowboys (牛仔) who would sing at night to the cows they were watching.

Most computers work best at a temperature of 5-30 degrees centigrade.\nl     Do not let people smoke cigarettes near your computer. Smoke of all kinds is very bad for many parts of a computer and can cause many problems.\nl     Do not eat or drink when you are near your computer. Pieces of food and a little water in the keyboard can also cause many problems.\nl     Make sure that the keyboard and the screen are the correct height for you. If they are not correct, you'll get backache.\nl     Make sure the screen is the correct distance from your eyes. If you wear glasses, make sure these glasses are correct for using with the computer. Some people use a different pair of glasses when they use a computer.\nl     Keep your screen clean and do not have it too bright. A dirty screen can hurt your eyes.

These kinds of thoughts stop you from getting your dream, the book says.\nIn fact, everyone can make his dream come true. The first thing you must do is to remember what your dream is.\nDon't let it leave your heart. Keep telling yourself what you want. Do this step by step and your dream will come true faster because a big dream is, in fact, many small dreams.\nYou must also never give up your dream. There will be difficulties on the road to your dreams. But the biggest difficulty comes from yourself. You need to decide what is the most important. Studying instead of watching TV will lead to better exam results, while saving five yuan instead of buying an ice cream means you can buy a new book.\nAs you get closer to your dream, it may change a little.

They say that there are several kinds of food that people should eat every day, they are: (1) green and yellow vegetables of all kinds; (2) citrus (柑桔) fruits and tomatoes; (3) potatoes and other fruits and vegetables; (4) meat of all kinds, fish and eggs; (5) milk and foods made from milk; (6) bread or cereal (谷类), rice is also in this kind of food; (7) butter, or something like butter.\nParagraph 2\nPeople in different countries and different places of the world eat different kinds of things. Foods are cooked and eaten in many different kinds of ways. People in different countries eat at different times of the day. In some places people eat once or twice a day; in other countries people eat three or four times a day. Scientists say that none of the differences is really important. It doesn't matter whether foods are eaten raw or cooked, canned (罐装的) or frozen (冷冻的). It doesn't matter if a person eats dinner at 4 o'clock in the afternoon or at eleven o'clock at night. The important thing is what you eat every day.\nParagraph 3\nThere are two problems, then, in feeding the large number of people on the earth. The first is to find some way to feed the world's population so that no one is hungry. The second is to make sure that people everywhere have the right kinds of food to make them grow to be strong and healthy.",

That was al!. He did not write his name, or any name. The words were just WILL YOU HELP? Pedro took the money一box to the club. He put it on a table just inside the door. Every Friday evening he opens the box. I do not belong to the Ajax Sport Club, but I went there last Friday evening with Pedro. He opened the money一box and took out the money. “Not bad,”he said. “ Between two and three pounds.” He shut the box then, and put it back on the table. The money went into Pedro's pocket. “ People are kind,”Pedro said. “They like to help. They like to give some money away.” “Are you going to keep the money?”I asked. “ Yes. I'm not a rich man, and that box is mine.”I asked, “ Did someone ask about the box?”“ No. They never ask questions. People don't like to ask questions about money・",

At last he had to leave for Paris with her at once. Their flight number was BA 347. They arrived at the hospital in the evening. A friend of their son's asked, \" When did you start, Mr White?\" \" At half past five,\" answered Mr White. \"Today or yesterday?\" \"What's the date today?\" \"July 3.\" \"Oh, I remember,\" called out Mr White. \"We started this afternoon.\" \"How did you come here, by air or by sea?\" \"I don't know,\" answered Mr White. \"You'd better ask my wife. She always arranges these things.\"",

Like thousands of students \" early birds\" in China, he has to get up before six every morning.\nA report shows that without a good night's sleep, students seem to be weaker (虚弱)than they should be. Many students have fallen asleep during class at one time or another. Too much homework is not the only reason why students stay up late. Some watch TV or play the computer games late into the night.\nExperts have ever said that the students should develop good study habits.

I learned in the newspaper that tickets could be bought at the cinema box office (售票处) in Richland Hills any day between 10:00 and 4:00. Since I work from 9:00 to 5:30, the only time I could go to the cinema was during my 45-minute lunch time. It is a pity (可惜) that the cinema is on the other side of the town, and the bus service between my office and Richland Hills is not very good. But if you are lucky, you can make the round trip in 45 minutes. Last Monday I stood at the bus stop for fifteen minutes, waiting for a bus. By the time I saw one coming around the corner, there was not enough time left to make the trip―so I had to go back to the office. The same thing happened on Tuesday, and again on Wednesday. On Thursday my luck changed. I got on a bus right away and arrived at the office. I heard one man say he had been waiting in line for over an hour. I found that I would not have enough time to wait in line. I caught the next bus and went back across the town. By Friday I understood my only hope was to make the trip by car. It was expensive, but I felt it would be worth(值得) it to see the film. The trip by car only took 10 minutes, but it felt like an hour to me. When I reached the cinema, I was delighted to see that nobody was waiting in line. But I quickly found that it was because they had already sold the tickets.",

But people may ask the question, \"What clothes are in fashion?\" And they use the adjective \"fashionable\" in the same way: \"She was wearing a fashionable coat.\" \"His shirt was really a fashionable colour.\"\nBut of course there are fashions in many things, not only in clothes.There are fashions in holidays, in restaurants, in films and books. There are even fashions in school subjects, jobs… and in languages.\nFashions changes as time goes. If you look at pictures of people or things from the past, you will see that fashions have always changed. An English house of 1750 was different from the one of 1650. A fashionable man in 1780 looked very different from his grandson in 1860.\nToday fashions change very quickly. Some of this is natural. We hear about things much more quickly than in the past . Newspapers, radios, telephones and television send information from one country to another in a few hours.\nNew fashions mean that people will buy new things, so you see there is money in fashion.",

Parties are most often held to welcome the New Year. At these parties, there is food and drink and dancing until the time nears for the coming of New Year.\nAt midnight, people often say \"Happy New Year\" to each other. Champagne(香槟酒)  is a favorite drink at New year's. In many western countries fireworks(烟火) are let off at midnight, and many people like to make noise, possibly to drive away bad spirits(幽灵).\nOne important song is often sung at New Year's --- the Scottish song of Auld Lang Syne( good times long ago).",

You may use a piano or any other musical instrument(乐器), if someone can play it. You may use a tape-recorder. You can even use a radio.\nPut the chairs in a row. The chairs may be put in two rows, back to back. A better way is to have the chairs in one row with each chair facing in the opposite direction(方向) to the chair next to it.\nThe game is easy. When the music starts, the players walk round the chairs. Every one goes in the same direction, of course. They should walk in time to the music. If the music is fast they should walk quickly. If the music is slow, they should walk slowly.\nThe person playing music cannot see the people in the game. When the music stops, the players try to sit on chairs. If he has no chair to sit on, he drops out. Then, before the music starts again, one chair must be taken away. When the music stops again, one more player will be out.\nAt last, there will be two players and one chair! The one who sits on the chair when the music stops is the winner.",

You may think you're not very good at some school subjects, or that .it is impossible for you to become a writer. These kinds of thoughts stop you from getting your dream, the book says. In fact, everyone can make his dream come true. The first thing you must do is to remember what your dream is. Don't let it leave your heart. Keep telling yourself what you want. Do this step by step and your dream will come true faster because a big dream is, in fact, many small dreams. You must also never give up your dream. There will be difficulties on the road to your dreams. But the biggest difficulty comes from yourself. You need to decide what is the most important. Studying instead of watching TV will lead to better exam results, while saving five yuan instead of buying an ice cream means you can buy a new book. As you get closer to your dream, it may change a little. This is good as you have the chance to learn more skills and find new interests.",

To make the runner's body work, harder training is quite necessary.  A runner should start to prepare for a marathon at least three months before. Preparation may  have races, many hours of running at different speeds and changes in diet(饮食). During the training time the runner must eat a fit diet. The diet should have lots of things needed in training the players.\nIn the early days of training, runners run 80km per week. The running is increased every two or three weeks and at least two long runs per week are needed. Two weeks before the marathon, the training programme becomes less, from 100km per week down to 60km and then to 30km in the final week. On the last two days they may not run at all.\nBreakfast should be eaten at least three hours before the race. Easily digested(消化)food such as cereal(麦), toast(烤面包) and scrambled(炒碎) egg is best, with as much fluid(液体) as possible. Runners should drink water about half an hour before the race to keep up the body fluid.",

They soon went on to other countries in the south and southeast Asia as well as East Africa .\nTsunamis are especially dangerous for children .By Wednesday ,nearly 60,000 people died because of the tsunamis .One third of them were children .\nChildren make up at least half of the people in Asia .The walls of water have killed many members of Asia families .In many Asia countries near the sea ,poor kids helped their parents fish .So they were in harm's way when the tsunamis came .\nIn Sri Lanka ,when the first waves hit ,thousands of children came to the seaside .The waves brought in fish .The old and the young collected them .Many waited to see more .Then tsunamis six meters high hit the island of 19 million people .\n\"They got caught and could not run to safety. This is the reason why so many children have died .\" said a policeman in Sri Lanka .\nTsunamis are caused by earthquakes .When two large pieces of the earth run into one another ,an earthquake happens.The movement gives the sea water a sudden push and makes it move fast.Scientists don't know when an earthquake will happen ,so they could not tell people about the tsunamis .\nIn open seas tsunamis are only one or two meters high .When they are near the land ,they are as high as 10 meters .Houses and cars near the sea can be taken away by these big waves .Because tsunamis move fast and can travel to another side of the sea within one day , they may affect (影响) a lot of places .\nThe Pacific Ocean(太平洋)has a lot of strong tsunamis because of the size of the ocean and larg earthquakes there .China doesn't see tsunamis often because its sea floor is quite flat .Islands around China also help the_country _stay away from them .\nWhat should you do when there's a tsunamis ?Move to a safe place .If you are near the sea and you feel the earthquake , move to higher ground .Stay away from rivers and streams .",

Today, however, many women prefer to use Ms rather than Mrs or Miss. The word “Mr\" doesn't tell us whether or not a man is married, Many women think this is an advantage for men. They want to be equal to men in this way. These women feel that it is not important for people to know whether they are married or not. There are some problems with Ms, however. Not all women like it. Some like the older ways of doing things. Some find it difficult to pronounce. Generally, young women like it better than older women do.

At one time, some people even drank blood to make them strong! When doctors understand how blood goes around inside the body, they try ways of giving blood to people who need it. They take blood from the healthy people and give it to people who need it. This is called \"blood transfusion\". The blood goes from the arm of the sick person. But there are two problems. First, it does not always work. Sometimes people die when they have blood transfusion. Later, doctors find that we do not all have the same kind of blood. There are four groups --- O, A, B and AB. We all have blood of one of these groups. They also find that they can give any kind of blood to people of group AB. But they find that they must give A group blood to A group people and B group blood to B group people. I have O group blood and the doctor told me that I could give blood to anyone else safely. There is another problem. To give blood of the right kind, doctors have to find a person of the right blood group. Often they can not find a person in time. If they have a way to keep the blood until someone needs it, they can always have the right kind of blood. At first they find they can keep it in bottles for fifteen to twenty days. They do this by making it very cold. Then they find how to keep it longer. In the end they find a way of keeping blood for a very long time. We call a place where we keep money a \"bank\". We call a place where we keep blood a \"blood bank\". One day, when you grow up, you may decide to give blood to a \"blood bank\". In this way you may stop someone from dying. Or perhaps one day you become ill. You may need blood. The \"blood bank\" will give it to you.",

So a new network system had to be set up. It should be good enough to be used by many different computers. If part of the network was not working, information could be sent through another part. In this way computer network system would keep on working all the time.At first the Internet was only used by the government, but in the early 1970s, universities, hospitals and banks were allowed to use it, too. However, computers were still very expensive and the Internet was difficult to use. By the start of 1990s, computers became cheaper and easier to use. Scientists had also developed software that made \"surfing\" the Internet easier.Today it is easy to get on-line and it is said that millions of people use the Internet every day. Sending e-mail is more and more popular among young people.The Internet has now become one of the most important parts of people's life.",

Like thousands of students \" early birds\" in China, he has to get up before six every morning.\nA report shows that without a good night's sleep, students seem to be weaker (虚弱)than they should be.

That was nearly impossible for a woman in the middle of the nineteenth century. After writing many letters to medical schools, she was finally accepted by a doctor in Philadelphia. So determined was she, that she taught school and gave music lessons to earn money for her school.\nIn 1849, after graduation from medical school, she decided to further her education in Paris. Upon returning to the United States, she found it difficult to start her own practice because she was a woman. By 1856, Elizabeth and her sister, also a doctor, managed to open a new hospital, the first for women and children. Besides being the first female physician and founding own hospital, she also set up the first medical school for women.",

It happened that there were two brothers in prison at that time. They were twins and were almost exactly alike in every way. They had both been sentenced to death(判处死刑). The King decided to let them live if one of the men agreed to drink several cups of tea each day and the other several cups of coffee.\nBoth brothers lived many years without problems of any kind. At last, the brother who had drunk tea every day died at the age of 83, the other died a few years later.\nBecause of the experiment, tea and coffee got accepted(接受) and became popular as drink in Sweden, and it is one of the many countries of the world where much tea and coffee is drunk today.",

I don't want to call him and say that I don't understand him.\" His wife thought for a while and then she had an idea. \"Take it to the chemist,\" she said, \"He will be able to(能) read it for us.\" \"Thank you,\" said her husband. \"That's a good idea.\" He went to the chemist's shop and gave the doctor's \"note\" to him. The chemist looked at it for a long time. \"Could you wait a moment, sir?\" he said. Then he went to the back of his shop. After a few minutes he came back, carrying a large bottle. He gave the bottle to the man. \"Take one spoonfu(一匙) every day.\"he said.",

I knew then that it was Pisa and no pizza. But there was still something special about it for me. The tower got its name because it really does lean to one side. Some people want to try to fix it. They are afraid it may fall over and they don't like it leans over the city.\nI do not think it's a good idea to try to fix it. The tower probably will not fall down. It is 600 years old. Why should anything happen to it now? And, if you ask me, I like what it looks like. To me it is a very human kind of leaning. Nothing is perfect, it seems to say.\nAnd who cares? Why do people want things to be perfect? Imperfect things may be more interesting. Let's take the tower in Pisa. Why is it so famous? There are many other older, more beautiful towers in Italy.

A man called Hermann Gmeiner wanted to help these children. His idea was simple. He wanted orphans to have a home, and he wanted them to have the care and kindness of parents. Gmeiner asked people to give him some money. With this money he built the first SOS Children's Village at Imst, in Austria. It opened in1949. This is how the SOS stand for \"Save OurSouls(灵魂).\" This means \"Please help us!\" An SOS Children' village gives help to orphans.\nHermann Gmeiner's idea for helping orphans soonspread(传播)all over the world. By 1983 there were 170 SOS Children's Villages in the world. People in many countries give money to help the villages. Today the children from the first village have grown up. Now some of them work in other SOS Children's Villages.\nIn SOS Villages orphans live in family groups. There are several houses in each village. The biggest village has 40 or 50 houses! Between seven and ten children live in a house. A woman lives with each group of children and looks after them. She gives the children a lot of love and kindness. She cooks meals for them and makescomfortable(舒适的), happy home for them.\nOf course, the children don't spend all their time in the village. They go to school, they go out with their friends. But the village gives them a home―sometimes for the first time in their lives.",

I tried to repair the car myself but couldn’t find out what was wrong with the engine (发动机). By then I was completely (完全地) wet. Just then a young man stopped his car to help. He drove my family home first and later came back with a mechanic (机修工). He did not leave until the mechanic started my car and I was on my way home again.

Like thousands of students \" early birds\" in China, he has to get up before six every morning. A report shows that without a good night's sleep, students seem to be weaker (虚弱) than they should be. Many students have fallen asleep during class at one time or another. Too much homework is not the only reason why students stay up late. Some watch TV or play the computer games late into the night.

He put it in a window of his house and took a picture of his garden. That was the first photo.\nThe next important date in the history of photography(摄影术)was in 1837.That year, Daguerre, another Frenchman, took a picture of his reading-room. He used a new kind of camera in a different way. In his picture you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest thing.The kind of photo was called a Daguerreotype.\nSoon, other people began to use Daguerre's way. Travellers brought back wonderful photos from all round the world. People took pictures of famous buildings, cities and mountains.\nIn about 1840, photography was developed. Then photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. That was not simple. The photographers had to carry a lot of film and other machines.But this did not stop them, for example, some in the United States worked so hard.\nMathew Brady was a famous American photographer. He took many pictures of great people. The pictures were unusual because they were very lifelike(栩栩如生).\nPhotographers also became one kind of art by the end of the 19thcentury. Some photos were not just taken of the real world, they showed ideas and feelings, like other kinds of art.",

After he bought them, he went into a restaurant and sat down at a table. When he looked around, he saw some old people put glasses on before reading their newspapers. So after lunch he decided to go to a shop to buy himself one pair, too. He walked along the road, and soon found a shop.\nThe man in the shop let him try on a lot of glasses, but Tom always said, \"No, I can't read with these.\"\nThe man became puzzled (迷惑的) , and he said, \"Excuse me, but can you read?\"\n\"No, of course I can't!\" Tom said angrily. \"If I could read before, do you think I would come here to buy your glasses?\"",

New challenges are fun and give you a sense of accomplishment when you have finished.\n5) Read and start a diary. Turn off the TV and let your imagination fly! Write down your thoughts, dreams or anything you want! Writing always helps to express your feelings.\n6) Stay with your family. We all need our family time.

On Friday night, three men came into the hotel and asked for rooms. Mr. King said there were no rooms ready because of the meeting. The men were unhappy.Mr. King wanted to help them. He remembered that Room 418, a very small room, was empty. He asked them if they would share a room. The three men said they would. Mr. King said the room would be thirty dollars: ten for each one. Each man gave him the money and then went up to the room.Mr. King soon began to feel sorry. \"Thirty dollars is a lot to ask as price for that small room.\" he thought. He called his assistant over and said, \"Here is five dollars. Take it to the men in Room 418. I asked too much for their room.\"The assistant took the money. While he was on the way there, he started to think, \"How can three men divide five dollars? I'll give them each only one dollar and keep the two dollars for myself. The men will be happy to get something back, and Mr. King will never know.\" So the assistant returned one dollar to each man.Each man had at first paid ten dollars. After the assistant returned them one dollar each, each had paid nine. There were three men, $ 9Ⅹ3 = $ 27. The assistant kept $ 2.$ 27 + $ 2 = $ 29. Where is the missing dollar?",

Others like flowers because they think different flowers mean different things. Flowers have their own language. For example, red roses mean \"love\" and sunflowers mean \"loyalty\". So people in more than 100 countries have chosen their own national flowers which say something about their countries' spirit. In 1994, China talked about choosing a national flower. Some people liked the peony but others liked the plum blossom. They couldn't agree with each other. So it has not been decided yet.\nPeople like to buy different flowers in different seasons. Where do all the beautiful flowers in shops come from? They may come from far away, so their price is higher.\na. Farmers grow flowers in their fields.\nb. Planes or trains or buses take the flowers to different places.\nc. Flower shopkeepers buy flowers from the flower markets. They look at the flowers and throw away the broken or bad ones. They cut the flowers to make them more beautiful.\nd. You go to buy the flowers in the shops. When you buy a flower, you're paying lots of people: the farmer, the driver of the plane or train or bus. The seller in the flower market and the flower shopkeeper.\nSo you'd better keep your flowers from far away for a long time. But how? Why not dry them? It's easy! Sand drying is a way. Dry, clean sand is one of the oldest things for drying flowers. And it's one of the cheapest.\n・Fill a box half-way with sand.\n・Put the flowers on top of the sand.\n・Put the box in a warm, dry place.\n・Leave the flowers there for one to three weeks.\n・Take them out and they will be dry.",

It was being talked a lot among teachers and students in Foshan city.\nAll schools have their own rules. In most schools, boy students are not allowed to wear long hair while girls are not allowed to dye their hair. And most school rules say that students should wear their school uniforms at school. No students can disobey these rules so that students can grow healthily at school.\nMost students are for these rules. But some students disagree them strongly. They think that boy students wear long hair doesn't mean that they are not good students. Teenagers want to show of their own personality. They like fashion. They admire famous stars, even the stars' hairstyle and clothes.\nA girl student thinks that she looks much more beautiful when she wears brown hair. So she had her dark hair dyed brown one day. When she went back to school the next day, the teacher of her class got very angry with her. When she was asked why she had her hair dyed, she just answered, \"I like it.\" She says that she works hard at her lessons and does well in every subject. She just doesn't know why the teacher doesn't allow her to dye her hair while women teachers can dye their long hair. Some boys think that their stars often wear long hair, so they think that they will look cool too if they wear long hair and wear the hairstyle like their favorite stars.\nIt is not wrong for teenagers to admire stars, wear their favorite clothes or hairstyle. However, a school has its own rules for all the students to follow so that the school can be in good order. Students should not break the rules at school. But if they are outside school, they have their right to wear what they like.",

I went to see my parents as usual. After the plane took off, we were flying low over the city and slowly gaining height, when the plane suddenly turned round and flew back to the airport.

Later we learnt that there was a very important person on the plane. The police were told that a bomb had been put on the plane. After we had landed, the plane was searched carefully.

He remembered that Room 418, a very small room, was empty. He asked them if they would share a room. The three men said they would. Mr. King said the room would be thirty dollars: ten for each one. Each man gave him the money and then went up to the room.Mr. King soon began to feel sorry. \"Thirty dollars is a lot to ask as price for that small room.\" he thought. He called his assistant over and said, \"Here is five dollars. Take it to the men in Room 418. I asked too much for their room.\"The assistant took the money. While he was on the way there, he started to think, \"How can three men divide five dollars? I'll give them each only one dollar and keep the two dollars for myself. The men will be happy to get something back, and Mr. King will never know.\" So the assistant returned one dollar to each man.Each man had at first paid ten dollars. After the assistant returned them one dollar each, each had paid nine. There were three men, $ 9Ⅹ3 = $ 27. The assistant kept $ 2.$ 27 + $ 2 = $ 29. Where is the missing dollar?",

Others like flowers because they think different flowers mean different things. Flowers have their own language. For example, red roses mean \"love\" and sunflowers mean \"loyalty\". So people in more than 100 countries have chosen their own_national flowers_which say something about their countries' spirit. In 1994, China talked about choosing a national flower. Some people liked the peony but others liked the plum blossom. They couldn't agree with each other. So it has not been decided yet.\nPeople like to buy different flowers in different seasons. Where do all the beautiful flowers in shops come from? They may come from far away, so their price is higher.\na. Farmers grow flowers in their fields.\nb. Planes or trains or buses take the flowers to different places.\nc. Flower shopkeepers buy flowers from the flower markets. They look at the flowers and throw away the broken or bad ones. They cut the flowers to make them more beautiful.\nd. You go to buy the flowers in the shops. When you buy a flower, you're paying lots of people: the farmer, the driver of the plane or train or bus. The seller in the flower market and the flower shopkeeper.\nSo you'd better keep your flowers from far away for a long time. But how? Why not dry them? It's easy! Sand drying is a way. Dry, clean sand is one of the oldest things for drying flowers. And it's one of the cheapest.\n・Fill a box half-way with sand.\n・Put the flowers on top of the sand.\n・Put the box in a warm, dry place.\n・Leave the flowers there for one to three weeks.\n・Take them out and they will be dry.",

Towards the end of the dinner the lights in the room are turned off, and someone comes in from another room with a cake on which there are lighted candles, one for each year.\nSeeing the birthday person, the guests begin singing \"Happy Birthday to You\" and the birthday person makes a wish before he or she blows out the candles on the cake.

Or when your best friend does not wait for you after school?\nIf you do, you need to take control (控制) of your feelings and stop getting angry so easily. Getting angry with people can cause you to lose friends.\nGary Egeberg, an American high school teacher, has written \"My Feelings Are Just Like Wild Animals\" to help you control your feelings. It tells teens how to stay cool when bad things happen to them.\nThe book says that getting angry only makes problems worse. It can never make them better. Getting angry is not a natural(天然的) way to act, the book says. It is just a bad habit (习惯), like smoking(抽烟). The book says you can control your anger(生气) easily ---- all you have to do is tell yourself not to be angry.\nWhen a baby falls over, it only cries if people are watching it. Like a baby, you should only get angry if you are sure it is the right thing to do.\nThe book gives many tips(建议) to help you if you get angry easily. Here are our top three:\n1. Keep a record. Every time you get angry write down why you are angry. Look at it later and you will see you get angry too easily.\n2. Ask your friends to stop talking to you when you get angry. This will teach you not to be angry.\n3. Do something different. When you get angry, walk away from the problem and go somewhere else. Try to laugh!",

It looks like a ring of land with trees, grass, and flowers on it. One part of the ring is open to the water. There is a little round lake inside the island.\nIf you look at a piece of coral, you will see many little holes in it. In each of these holes a very small animals has lived. There sea animals make the coral. They began to build under the water. Year after year, the coral grew higher and higher. At last it grew out of water.\nThen the sea brought it to small trees and something else. After some tears, these things changed into a earth. Sometimes birds flew over it and brought seeds to the island.\nThe little seeds grew. In a few years there were plants all over the island. In a few more years there were trees growing there.\nSo you see, these island were built by little. The workers were very small. Do they not teach us a lesson ? Can you think what the lesson is?",

If your school has five weeks holiday next year, perhaps you'll be able to stay with us for two or three weeks.\nWe are long back at school three weeks now. It feels like three months! I hope that you are both working very hard now that you are in Grade One. I shall have to work hard next year when I am in Grade One. Tom and Ann won't be in Grade One until 2002.\nThey went for a picnic yesterday but I didn't go with them because I cut my foot and I couldn't walk very well. They went to an island(岛)and enjoyed themselves there. Do you still remember the island? That's where all five of us spent the last day of our holiday.\nTom, Ann and I send our best wishes to Betty and you. We hope to see you soon.\nYours sincerely,\nMichael",

The peacocks mostly live on the grass land of Dongfeng Square.\nThey are given food freely by visitors. They usually throw food to them, and don't think about at all whether the food is right or not. Some of the peacocks become ill, some even died after eating the bad food given by the visitors. I'm sure most of the visitors who throw food to the peacocks really like the birds, but don't realize that they may be doing them harm. The visitors should be told that what have done is very harmful to the birds, and this kind of thing must be stopped from happening. Perhaps we can build some small shops beside Dongfeng Square to sell peacock food. For us every person, it's our duty to give more love to these beautiful birds and to look after them carefully.\nYours,\nSun Yan",
