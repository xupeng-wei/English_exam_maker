They are very kind. They eat much grass every day. There are many monkeys in the zoo, too. Children like them and they like children, too. They like children because children sometimes give them bananas. They like bananas very much. There are three black bears and four white ones in the zoo. They can stand on their back legs, hold up their arms and play with each other like small children. They love candy very much. There are also some tigers from India.

About one fifth of the air is <blank text=56>, which is needed by all living things. About four fifths of the air is nitrogen(氮). Plants need it to live. There are other gases in the air. The most important among them is carbon dioxide. Green plants use carbon dioxide to make food. People give off carbon dioxide when they breathe.\nAir has <blank text=58> and takes up space. Air pressure (压力) inside our body is almost the same as air pressure outside. Because of this balance, we don't feel the pressure of the air on us.\nSince the sun's heat affects the earth's air, the weather conditions on the earth change greatly: warm or hot; cool or cold; sunny or cloudy; windy, rainy, or snowy.\nWhen temperature changes, what happens to the air? When air is being heated, it expands(膨胀). That means it takes up more space. When air is being cooled, it takes up less space, or contracts(收缩).",

Some people have a very good memory and they can easily learn many things by heart, but some people can only remember things when they say or do them again and again.\nA good memory helps one learn a language well. Everybody learns his own language when he is a small child. He hears the sounds, remembers them and then he learns to speak. Some children are living with their parents in foreign countries. They can learn two languages easily because they hear, remember and speak the two languages every day. In school it is not easy to learn a foreign language because the students have little time for it and they have to learn other subjects,too.\nOur memory can get better and better if we do more and more exercises. Do you want to learn a foreign language well? If so, you must do a lot of listening and speaking.",
