Even though Sam was in America, he had not forgotten Tom's birthday. Tom wanted to open the parcel right away 37 he was eager (渴望的) to see what birthday present Uncle Sam had 38 to him. But I stopped him firmly. His birthday's not until tomorrow. \"You 39 open it tomorrow morning together with your other presents,\" I said to him. Tom was really a 40 boy. The next day, 41 was just as excited as Tom when they discovered that there was an electric train set in the parcel. They went upstairs immediately to put it together.\nTom was with his father for about an hour but finally 42 playing with the toy train and went into the living room to see the rest of his presents.\nAbout lunch time, I came into 43. \"Where's your father?\" I asked, \"I've been looking for him everywhere.\"\n\"He's in the hall, Mum.\" Tom answered, \"He put my train set together this 44 and he has been playing with it ever since.\"\n(233 w)",
