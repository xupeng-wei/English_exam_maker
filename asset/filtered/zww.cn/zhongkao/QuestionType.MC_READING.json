Other people may tell you what to do, but you should not listen to them. You must only do what you want. If you always wear clothes like your favorite TV star, for example, you must stop doing so. Instead, become your own star and wear the clothes you want. The book also tells girls to start liking how they look. You have to like your body, it says. If you don't, you will not take good care of it and won't stay healthy. The book also says that girls must start becoming more confident. If you're confident, you'll succeed in life.\nA good way to become confident is to realize that you are as clever as boys. You are, just look at their grades! Today's brave new girls will become tomorrow's brave new women. Only they can realize their dreams and become who they want to be.",

Well read on, as this month we're going to hear from overseas teens about what they do to help the environment.\nI can't remember when I started collecting litter(垃圾). But it was when I got tired of seeing litter near my home and realized that no one else was going to pick it up.\nI live close to a forest in Ohio, America. I can walk there in three minutes!\nI used to love going there to play with my dog. But one day there was so much litter there that I became very unhappy. I decided I had to clan up the forest. I wanted to feel happy going there again.\nI made my first trip to clean the forest that afternoon. I took a big black rubbish bag with me. Ten minutes after starting to pick up litter, my bag was full! It had cans, bottles, broken glass and newspapers in it.\nSince that first trip three years ago. I've gone to the forest four times a year to pick up litter. I'm often there for three hours. It makes me feel great to do something for the environment.\nAfter each trip, I look at all the litter I've found. If any of it is recyclable(可回收的), I keep it.\nI can't understand why people drop litter. But I will keep picking it up until they stop dropping it.\nI know I am only doing a small bit to help the Earth, but I still think it is important.",

But birds cannot easily catch them. Why? It is because locusts change their colours together with the change of the colours of crops. When crops are green, locusts look green. But as the harvest time comes, locusts change to the same brown colour as crops have. Some other pests with different colours from plants are easily found and eaten by others. So they have to hide themselves for lives and appear only at night.\nIf you study the animal life, you'll find the main use of colouring is protecting themselves. Bears, lions and other animals move quietly through forests. They cannot be seen by hunters. This is because they have the colours much like the tree.\nHave you ever noticed an even more strange act? A kind of fish in the sea can send out a kind of very black liquid when it faces danger. While the liquid spread(散布)over, the enemies cannot find it. And it immediately swims away. So it has lived up to now though it isn't strong at all.",

Later today we will leave for Chiang Mai. We will take the train north, stay in Chiang Mai for two days, and then catch a bus to Chiang Rai.\nFriday,March 30th\nOur trip to Chiang Rai was long and boring. We visited a small village in the mountains. The village people here love the quiet life --- no computers or phones. They are the kindest people I have ever met. They always smile and say \"hello\".

And most junior high schools will begin the first class at about 8:30 am.\nThe students are happy about the change.\nLiu Ming told us that his class were excited by the news on the first day of school. \"Great! From now on we students at Chengdu No. 4 Middle School don't have to get up so early!\" Liu said that he used to get up at 6:40 am. Now he can get up at 7:40 am because class doesn't start until 8:40 am.\nWu Hongli feels the same. She said the new timetable (时间表) was good for her health. \"I used to get up at 6:30 am. I had to drink coffee every night, or I would feel too sleepy to finish my homework,\" said Wu. \"Now I can finish it without coffee. Because I can sleep a little longer.\"\nMany teachers say the change will help students learn better. \"Students used to doze (瞌睡) for the first two classes in the morning,\" said Huang Shan, an English teacher at Chengdu No. 12 Middle School. \"But now they are active in class and learn much better than before.\"\nBut some parents are worried that more sleep will mean less learning. There used to be five classes in the morning. Now there are only four.\nIn fact, every coin has two sides. So does the change in the school timetable.",

In the same way, children learning to do all the other things without being taught―to walk, run, climb, whistle, ride a bicycle―compare their own performances with those of more skilled people, and slowly made the needed changes. But in school we never give a child a chance to find out his mistakes and correct them for himself. We do it all for him. We act as if we thought that he would never notice a mistake unless it was pointed out to him, or correct it unless he was made to.

It begins to work as soon as it begins to live. Every spider is a weaver. Even the youngest spider knows how to weave (编织) its web (网) just as well as the oldest.\nThe silk of which it makes its web comes from its body. It is like hairs. Many of these hairs come out at the same time, but they are all formed into one rope of silk. It is so thin that a hundred of them together are only as thick as a human hair.\nFirst the spider fasten (固定) one end of the silk thread (丝线) to a leaf or to a piece of wood, then it turns and fastens it to the other end.\nWhen the spider fastens both ends, it can run down the silk and fix some more threads. These are the cross ropes of the web. Then it weaves other lines round them, and makes about twenty rings.\nThen spider works hard and fast, and it finishes its work in less than an hour. The web is then so strong that the wind cannot blow it away and the rain cannot break it. The purpose (目的) of the spider's web is to catch insects (昆虫), which are its food.\nInsects cannot walk or fly out of the web, because the spider covers it all with something like glue (胶水), which sticks to (粘) anything that touches the web and holds it fast (牢固).\nNot all the spiders are the same sort of work to do.\nSome spiders are masons(泥瓦匠). They build houses the size of a big thimble (顶针). They make doors in them, which they shut after them when they go in. They can even fasten the door of the house from the inside, so that no robber can get in.\nThe garden spider lets thread float in the air till they stick to plants or to the branches of trees. It then uses these threads as the roads or bridges to cross from one place to another.",

The man who arrived at the parking space first was rather old with gray hair. He was driving a large Rolls Royce. The beautiful car stopped just in front of the parking place. Then the driver turned and very slowly began to drive his car into the space. Just as he was doing this, a very young man in a Mini came up from behind. He noticed the space and drove straight in, nose first. The older driver in the Rolls Royce stooped his car suddenly. He was very angry and red in the face. He wound down his window and looked at the young man. But the young man wasn't sorry. He had got out of his car now and he was laughing. \"You have to be young to do that!\" he said to the old driver and pointed at his Mini very hard. There wasn't much room of the Mini left when the older driver had finished. The young man watched what was happening and couldn't believe his eyes. He was very angry and red in the face. The older driver looked out of the window and smiled. \" You have to be rich to do that,\", he said.",

Some people find exam time so bad that they become ill, because they are afraid of failing; they are afraid of letting their parents and families down. If exams are really making you ill or worried, don't hide your feelings. Talk to someone about it. How to get through exams? Here are some top tips by educational psychologists(教育心理学家): Ask a teacher or tutor about how to revise, and exam skills－how to work when you are in an exam. Take short rests during your time of work and revision. If your mind is tired, it will not remember well. Plan your work: revise at times when you know you will work at your best. Get enough sleep, and eat healthy food. If you feel ill, talk to someone about your worries. But don't be too relaxed! Some stress over exams makes you work hard for them. If it upsets(沮丧)you to talk to your friends about an exam when it is finished, don't do it! In fact, don't even think about the exam you have finished. What is done is done. You cannot change what you have written! To this advice, we would add: If you are studying in the evening, don't go straight to bed afterwards. Your mind will still be \"going round and round\"－thinking too much. Do something else, maybe walk or get exercise. Choose something that will relax you, and make you think of other things.",

This book is a journal I wrote last month for a very special competition. I won the first prize, which was that my book would become part of the first ever experiment in time travel. It would be put in a time capsule to be sent back almost fifty years into the past. So, if everything went according to the plan, you should be reading this in about the year 2005. Do you know what time capsules are? They are usually containers made of some very strong material－so strong that it should last for hundreds or thousands of years without being destroyed. Inside these containers, you put things that are typical of the place in which you live. For example, in 2005 you might put a copy of a popular comic, a CD by a famous musician, videos of television programmes－all sorts of things. The idea is that when people in another century open up the time capsule. They'll be able to see what life was like in the past. Until now, all time capsules have been left for people in the future to find. This one is the first that has been sent from the future to the past. I don't understand how it's going to be done, but I think it's a really cool idea. If it works, my own grandparents will be able to read this when they were secondary school students! But if my grandparents did read this, why haven't they ever mentioned it to me?",

For example, if your address is 73 Lemon Street, write down 73.\nSecond, multiply (乘) it by two. Then, add (加) five. For example, if your address is 73 and you multiply it by two, you will get 146. Then, if you add five, you will get 151.\nThird, multiply this number by 50. In our example here, if you multiply 151 by 50, you will get 7 550.\nFourth, add your age to this total (总数). For example, if you're 26 years old, you should add 26 to this total. In our example here, the result will be 7 550, add 26, you'll get 7 576.\nFifth, you have to add the number of days in a year, which is 365. In our example here, 365 add 7 576 is 7 941.\nThe sixth step is this: minus (减) 615 from the number that you have. In our example, 7 941 minus 615 is 7 326.\nThe result here, 7-3-2-6, is the game. The first part of the number is the ad­dress and the last part of the number is the age of the person.

Something to which I didn't think. The next year, I moved away and didn't call her for a long time. When I did, her mother told me that she had been dead for 2 years, because she had not a good health for anorexia(厌食).\nGirls in today's society(社会) are told that they need to be 1.70 cm, 50 kilos and so on.

The satellites take pictures of the atmosphere, because this is where the weather forms. They send these pictures to the weather station. So the scientists there can see the weather of any part of the world and tell how the weather will change.\nToday, nearly five hundred weather stations in sixty countries can receive satellite pictures. When they receive the new pictures, they compare them with the earlier ones. Perhaps they may find that the clouds have changed during the last few hours. This may mean that the weather on the ground may soon change, too.\nSo the weather satellites are of great help to the scientists at the station. In the past they could forecast the weather for about 24 or 48 hours earlier. Now they can make god forecasts for 3 or 5 days. Soon, perhaps, they may be able to forecast the weather for a week or more ahead.",

That's how thousands of people start their day at Laughter Clubs around the world ― and many doctors now think that having a good laugh might be one of the best ways to stay healthy.\nThe first Laughter Club was started in Mumbai, India, in 1995 by Dr. Madan Kataria. \"Young children laugh about 300 times a day. Adults laugh between 7 and 15 times a day,\" says Dr. Kataria. \"Everyone's naturally good at laughing ― it's the universal language. We want people to feel happy with their lives.\" There are now more than 500 Laughter Clubs in India and over 1,300 worldwide.\nMany doctors are also interested in the effects (效果) of laughter on our health. According to a 5-year study at the UCLA School of Medicine in California, with laughing there is less stress in the body. Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%.\nSo, what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to my nearest club in South London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class, to be honest ― I wasn't interested in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking stupid. Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands and say \"ho ho ho, ha ha ha,\" while looking at each other. However, our bodies can't tell the difference between fake laughter and real laughter, so they still produce the same healthy effects.\nSurprisingly, it works! After ten minutes everybody in the room was laughing for real ― and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class I was surprised by how relaxed and comfortable I felt. So if you're under stress, then start laughing. You might be very pleased with the results!",

            "context": "Each year Ben is glad when school is closed on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Ben knows that this day honors an important man, but Ben does not feel connected to him. However, the small-world theory (理论) connects Ben to Dr. King. Ben's mom (0) has a close friend, Amy (1). Amy's uncle, Mark (2), once met and spoke to John Carter (3), the son of President Jimmy Carter (4). Jimmy Carter knew Dr. King (5). In a way, Ben is only \"five people away\" from Martin Luther King Jr.\nThe small-world theory says that everyone in the world is connected through a short chain (链条) of people they know. Another name of this chain is degrees of separation. Each degree is a step that separates a person from someone he or she does not know. There are zero degrees of separation between a person and the people he or she knows directly. This means that there are zero degrees between Ben and his mom. There is one degree of separation when just one person separates someone from a person he or she does not know. Ben knows his mom, but he hasn't met her close friend Amy. Therefore, Ben is one degree away from Amy. As the chain continues, Amy's uncle, Mark, is two degrees. John Carter is three degrees, and his father is four degrees. Dr. King is five degrees away from Ben. The theory says that there are no more than six degrees of separation between any two people in the world.\nThe small-world theory has a lot to do with math. The theory assumes (假定) that each person knows 100 people. Each one of those 100 people knows 50 different people. Each of those 50 people knows another 50 people, and so on. When someone continues the calculation to six degrees, it is like this: 100 × 50 × 50 × 50 × 50 × 50 = 31.25 × 109. This number is greater than 31 billion (a billion = a thousand million). There are over 6 billion people in the world. These numbers show it is possible that six degrees of separation could include everyone in the world.\nDoes the small-world theory work? No one has ever proved it. Maybe the theory just invites people to think a little more about their places in the world.",

Most students are always being told by their parents to study harder so that they can have a wonderful life. Thought h this may be good ideas for those very brig students, it can have terrible results for many students because they are not gifted(有天赋的) enough.\nAs it is reported, a number of students killed themselves. Others try to get the feelings of taking drugs(毒品). Some join the groups of trouble-makers and turn t o crime(犯罪). Many of them have tried very hard at school but have failed in the exams and have their parents lose hopes. Such students felt that they are hated by everyone else they meet and they don't want to go to school any longer. They become dropouts.\nIt is surprising that thought most Japanese parents are worried about their children, they do not help them in any way. Many parents feel that they are not able to help their children and that it is the teachers' work to help their children. To make matters worse, a lot of parents send their children to those schools opening in the evenings and on weekends-they only help students to pa exams and never teach students any real sense(判断) of the world. It is a great surprise that almost three-quarters of middle school students have been to such kind of schools.\nMany Japanese schools usually have rules(规章) about everything from the student s' hair to their clothes and the things in their school bags. Child psychologists (心理学家) now think that such strict rules are harmful(有伤害的) to the feeling s of the students. Almost 40% of the students said that no one had taught them ho w to get on with others, how to tell rig from wrong, how to show love for others , even for their parents.",

This book is a journal I wrote last month for a very special competition. I won the first prize, which was that my book would become part of the first ever experiment in time travel. It would be put in a time capsule to be sent back almost fifty years into the past. So, if everything went according to the plan, you should be reading this in about the year 2005.\nDo you know what time capsules are? They are usually containers made of some very strong material－so strong that it should last for hundreds or thousands of years without being destroyed. Inside these containers, you put things that are typical of the place in which you live. For example, in 2005 you might put a copy of a popular comic, a CD by a famous musician, videos of television programmes－all sorts of things. The idea is that when people in another century open up the time capsule. They'll be able to see what life was like in the past.\nUntil now, all time capsules have been left for people in the future to find. This one is the first that has been sent from the future to the past. I don't understand how it's going to be done, but I think it's a really cool idea. If it works, my own grandparents will be able to read this when they were secondary school students! But if my grandparents did read this, why haven't they ever mentioned it to me?",

I like travelling and I have won a free four-week trip to England, but I know little about the British way of life. Would you please write to tell me something about the British meals? Thank you. Yours, Wang Lin January 1, 2005 Dear Wang Lin, It's very helpful to know something about the British meals before travelling. In many English houses, people eat four meals a day. They are breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner. Breakfast takes place at any time from 7:00 to 9:00 in the morning. They usually have eggs, bread with butter(黄油), cheese and so on. English people drink tea or coffee at breakfast. Lunch comes at one o'clock. It can be a hamburger or a three-course (三道菜) meal. Afternoon tea is between 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm. Dinner begins at about half past seven. The first course is soup. The next is often meat or fish with vegetables. Then come fruits of different kinds: apples, pears, bananas and so on. But not all English people eat like that. Some of them have their dinner in the middle of the day. Their meals are breakfast, dinner, tea and supper. And all these meals are usually simple. Wish you a good time in England! Yours, Rose",

When the ground turns dry, it becomes harder and harder for plants to do this.\nIn very hot days, plants have to get any water that it can.\nScientist Robert Winter has found out that when plants can get no water, their \"water pipes\" snap(发出断裂声) . When that happens, the whole plant vibrates( 振动 ) a little. The snapping pipes make noises ten thousand times more quiet than a whisper(低语).\nRobert knows that healthy, well-watered plants are quiet. He also knows that many insects (昆虫) prefer attacking dry plants rather than healthy plants. How do the insects know which are healthy plants and which are not?

Maria's headmaster, Mrs White, wants each of her 850 students and their families to learn the love of reading this year. She wants reading at home to become an activity of choice in every family, even during holiday breaks. \"I truly realize reading should be an important part of everyone's life, and nothing should stop it,\" sai-a Mrs White. \"The aim we want most of all is to help children understand they can enjoy reading, as well as practice their skills,\" said Hannas, an education researcher. He suggested parents take their children to the library and allow them to pick out books that interest them. Each night, students take home two books to read with their parents, or other family members. They have to return the books the next day with a signed note from their parents showing that the books were read, and have passing tests that check how well they understand the books. \"We're trying to get parents into the habit of reading with their kids,\" said the headmaster. \"Nothing is better than sitting on a sofa with your child and reading and laughing.\" Through books, Mrs Smith, a parent, said she's able to give her two daughters more experiences than she could. 'I think reading opens all the doors and creates imaginations in children,' she said. 'I think if you read well, you can succeed in anything in life.'",

No matter how hard I tried, I just could not figure out why I did not understand what all the other kids found to be so easy to learn. One day, I was told that if I got one more E on my report card, I would be sent away to a very strict school. I tried really hard for weeks to learn math. I just couldn't understand the math problems no matter how hard I tried. The day before report cards were to come out, I knew that Mr Young would give me an E, just like he always did. After class ended, I went to him and told him that they were going to send me to another school if I got another E on my report card. He told me that there was nothing he could do. It would be unfair to the other kids if he gave me a better grade than I had actually earned. I looked at the teacher and said, \"Mr Young, do you know how the kids laugh at you because you're missing your finger?\" He looked at me and said nothing. \"They shouldn't do that to you because you can't help you not having a finger, Mr Young. It's just like I can't help not being able to learn numbers and stuff like that,\" I said. The next day while on the school bus, I opened the report card envelope and looked at my math grade: D. That math grade was my favorite one I ever received in my whole life, because I knew that someone in the world finally understood what it was like for me to be missing a finger inside my head.",

We hope that you will both be able to come again next year. A week is not really long enough, is it? If your school has five weeks' holiday next year, perhaps you'll be able to stay with us for two or three weeks.\nWe have been back at school for three weeks now. It feels like three months! I expect that you are both working very hard now since you are in Grade One. I shall have to work hard next year when I am in Grade One. Tom and Ann won't be in Grade One until 2003.\nThey went for a picnic yesterday but I didn't go with them because I cut my foot and I couldn't walk very well. They went to an island and enjoyed themselves there. Do you still remember the island? That's where all five of us spent the last day of our holiday.\nTom, Ann and I send our best wishes to Betty and you. We hope to see you soon.\nYours sincerely,\nMichael",

There he read the writings of Thoreau, which gave him many ideas about freedom.\nAfter he finished studying in Morehouse, he went on to study at the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and Boston University. At Boston University, he met his wife, Corretta. In 1954, after he got his Ph. D. degree (哲学博士学位), he became a minister (牧师) of a small church in the South. Then he became the leader of the black people, who were poor and powerless. He gave speeches and led parades. For his ideas and actions, he was in prison for a short time.\nMany years later, in Washington D.C. he spoke to a crowd of 250,000 people. He told them \"I have a dream\". That speech is still famous today. In 1964 he won the Nobel Peace Prize. His work was not finished when he died on April 4. 1968. Who was he? He was Martin Luther King Jr..",

The best students won't only have high marks. They will also be kids who don't dye(染) their hair. The following are some of the new rules.\nTell the truth. Have you ever copied someone else's work on an exam? Don't do it again! That's not something an honest student should do. If you have played computer games for two hours in your room, don't tell your parents you have done homework.\nDo more at school. Good students love animals and care for other people. April is Bird-loving month in China. Is your school doing anything to celebrate? You should join! That way, you can learn more about animals and how to protect them. When more people work together, it makes it more fun for everyone.\nHave you ever quarreled with your teammates when your basketball team lost? Only working together can make your team stronger. Be friendly to the people you are with. Try to think of others, not only yourself.\nBe open to new ideas. Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon? Maybe you'll discover Earth Ⅱ someday. Don't look down on new ideas. Everyone's ideas are important. You should welcome them, because new ideas make life better for everyone.\nProtect yourself. Has someone ever taken money form one of your classmates? Don't let it happen to you. If you have to go home late, you should let your parents know.\nUse the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for your studies. But some things on the Internet aren't for kids, so try to look at Web pages that are good for you. You can use the Web for run or homework. Can't you find any good! Web sites for children? Here are some: Http:// kids.eastday.com Http ://www.chinakids. net.com http:www.Cycnet.com",

What is a picnic?\nFor most people a picnic is a meal they eat outside the home, usually in a park, by a river, or even sitting in a car if the weather is cold and wet. At one time however, people had picnics at home at their own dinner tables.\nThe word picnic comes from the French words \"pique\"―meaning \"to pick\" or to \"take\"―and\n\"nique\"―meaning \"a small coin\". Everyone who came to a picnic brought something to eat. They brought it on plate from which everyone took some food. They took―or picked―a small piece of food from each plate. They had a \"pique-nique\". This kind of meal was popular in Britain. The British used the French words for it but changed letters to make \"picnic\". That is the way we write it today.\nIn some countries there are picnics on special days. Lots of people go to parks on these picnics. For most people, however, a picnic is a family party. The family puts some food and drinks in a basket, gets in the car and goes off to a nice place in the country or by the sea.",

Many of them were very poor when they were young, and had no uncles, aunts, or friends to help them. Schools were few and not very good. They could not depend on them for education. They tried their best to learn something and never gave up till they became well known. One of the most famous teachers in England used to tell his pupils, \"I cannot make worthy* men of you, but I can help you make men you yourselves.\"\nSome young men don't try their best to make themselves valuable* to the human beings.

In dollar stores there are thousands of kinds of things and eve­rything is affordable ( 买得起).\nIf you go into a clothes shop, you find clothes. If you go into a car showroom, you see cars.

There'll be pots and pans for the kitchen, books, clothes, toys―and a thousand other things you never dreamed of! There's always a surprise in a dollar store.\nWhy are dollar stores so cheap? It's because they're full of stock (库存) that hasn't sold in other stores: clothes that were last year's fashion; books that won't sell; inventions for the kitchen that didn't catch on(流行).

If so, here are some suggestions you need to know about audience manners.\nMost sporting arenas (赛场) have rules for audience which are written on the back of the tickets. Read your ticket carefully before you arrive. Try to reach your seat half an hour before the start of the event and don't walk about when a game is being held. When you leave, remember to take away your soft drink botdes and other rubbish.\nDuring exciting games, try to control yourself. Don't criticize(批评) the performance of players and coaches. Be care­ful with your words, since some may cause anger among other people in the audience.\nApplause is a special form of body language you can use to communicate ( 交流) with players. But you should do it properly. When players first appear, clap your hands together to welcome them; don't go on for too long. After an excellent performance, applaud (鼓掌) warmly.\nApplause is not welcome, however, while a game is being held and the players need to focus all their attention. Differ­ent sports have different rules for the audience. Enjoying artistic gymnastics( 艺术体操)requires silence. But lots of cheering can really help basketball and football players. Using flash( 闪光灯)to take photos is quite disturbing to tennis players. Mobile phones can not be used in shooting centers.\nTo be a good spectator( 观众 ) , you should take time to learn the game―related rules and audience manners of each event.",

They are exciting, amazing and can even change our lives.\nBut have all these developments really improved the quality of our lives?\nPicture this: You're rushing to finish your homework on the computer. Your mobile phone rings, a message from your friend appears on the screen, the noise from the telephone is getting louder and louder. Suddenly the computer goes blank and you lose all your work. Now you have to stay up all night to get it done.\nInventions have speeded up our lives so much that they often leave us feeling stressed and tired. Why do you think people who live far away from noisy cities, who have no telephones, no cars, not even any electricity often seem to be happier? Perhaps that is because they live simpler lives.\nOne family in the UK went \"back in time\" to see what life was like without all the inventions we have today. The grandparents, with their daughter, and grandsons, Benjamin, 10, and Thomas, 7, spent nine weeks in a 1940s house. They had no washing machine, microwave, computer or mobile phone.\nThe grandmother, Lyn, said, \"The more things you have, the more difficult life becomes.\" The boys said they fought less. Probably, they said, because there was less to fight over, such as their computer. Benjamin also noticed that his grandmother had changed from being a trendy, been-drinking granny, to one who cooked things.",

Perhaps, after all, it is safer to be driven by a woman.\nThere are different kinds of color blindness. For example, a man cannot see deep red. He may think that red, orange and yellow are all shades(阴影) of green. Sometimes a person can't tell the difference between blue and green. Only a few unlucky men may see everything in shades of green―a strange world indeed.\nColor blindness in human beings is a difficult thing to explain. In only one eye there are millions of very small things called \"cones(圆锥体)\". These help us to see in the bright light and to tell differences between colors. There are also millions of \"rods(柱状体)\", but these are used for seeing when it is nearly dark. They show us shapes but not colors.\nSome insects have favorite colors. Mosquitoes(蚊子) like blue but do not like yellow. A red light will not attract insects, but a blue light will. Human beings also have favorite colors. Yet we are lucky. With the help of the cones in our eyes, we can see many beautiful colors by day, and with the help of the rods we can see shapes at night.",

Most members of the design teams have worked in the field for a long time. They hold advanced degrees in math, science, or engineering.\nBut things are changing. High costs, unusual educational requirements and long start-up times are no longer an_obstacle_to space exploration. The scientists at Stanford University have developed a new type of tiny, inexpensive earth-orbiting satellites that go from ideas to launch(发射) in a year.\nSo far, college students have built and launched several cube-shaped satellites, or Cubesats. At least 15 more are ready to go. Those already in orbit(轨道) take pictures, collect information and send it back to the earth, just as regular satellites do.\nBut you might not even have to wait until you get to college to start designing and building your own satellite. A new program called KatySat aims to get teenagers to take part. Once kids understand what satellites can do, says Ben Yuan, an engineer at Lockheed Martin in Menlo Park, Calif, the kinds of applications they'll come up with may be countless.\n\"We'd like to put this technology(技术) in your hands,\" he tells kids. \"We're going to teach you how to operate a satellite. Then we want to turn it over to you as a sandbox for you to play in. We want you to take the technology into new directions that we haven't thought of yet.\"\nEducation isn't the only goal of CubeSats. Because these tiny, technology-filled boxes are relatively inexpensive to build and can be put together quickly, they're perfect for testing new technologies that might one day be used on major space tasks.\nThe biggest challenge now is to find ways to bring the satellites back to the earth after a year or two. Otherwise, major highways of space junk could gradually increase as CubeSats become more common.\nNowdays challenge and high school students are getting a chance to learn what it takes to explore in space. Someday―perhaps a lot sooner than you imagine―you might get to design, build and launch your own satellite. If you do, you're sure to have fun. And you might also get crazy about science for life.",

It is strange that dolphins are friendly to men, and for thousands of years, there are many stories about dolphins and men. In the 19thcentury, in a dangerous part of the sea near New Zealand, there was a dolphin. The seamen liked him very much and gave him a very good name, Jack. From 1871 to 1903, Jack met every boat in the area and showed it the way. In 1903 a passenger on a boat with the name of The Penguin shot and hurt Jack. Luckily the dolphin didn't die, and after a long time he was well again. He guided the ships through the area for nine more years, but he refused to help the boat The Penguin. Today, some people still kill dolphins, but many countries in the world now protect them. In these places, people are not allowed to kill them.",

People always laughed at him. No one showed kindness to him. His only friend was a dog named Tige. He gave his dog enough to eat and drink, but sometimes he was not polite to it. He didn't know that an unkind work sometimes could cut one's heart like a knife. One day as he walked down the street, a young lady was walking in front of him. Suddenly one of her bags dropped from her arms. As she stopped to pick it up, she dropped other bags. He came to help her. \"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy!\" she said kindly, smiling. A special feeling came to him. These were the first kind worlds he had ever heard. He watched her until she went far away, and then he whistled (吹口哨)to his dog and went directly to the river nearby. \"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy!\" he repeated(重复) the woman's words. Then in a low voice he said to his dog!\" Tige raised its ears as if it understood. \"Uhum! Even a dog likes it!\" he said, \"Well, Tige, I won't say unkind words to you any more.\" Tige waved its tail happily. The boy thought and thought. Finally he looked at himself in the river. He saw a clean nice boy. He was amazed. From then on, he had a new life. After telling this, the businessman stopped for a while, and then he said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the very place where that kind woman planted in me the first seed(种子) of kindness. All of us should learn about kindness. What a great power(力量) it has!\"",

The USDA has prepared a food guide to help people learn about which kind of food is the healthiest to eat. The food guide describes six main food groups: meat (like fish and chicken), dairy(like milk and cheese), grains(like bread and rice), fruit, and vegetables. The last group is fats and sweets. The USDA also suggests(建议)how much of each food group is healthy to eat daily. Though this guide was prepared by the US government, it is very useful for people all over the world.\nAs a result of years of study, we know that too much animal fat is bad for our health. For example, Americans eat a lot of meat and only a small amount (量)of grains, fruit and vegetables. Because of the way they eat, they have a high rate (率)of cancer (癌症)and heart disease. In Japan, people eat large amounts of grains and very little meat. The Japanese also have a very low rate of cancer and heart disease. The Japanese live longer than anyone else in the world. However, when Japanese people move to the US, the rate of heart disease and cancer goes up as their eating habit changes. And as hamburgers, ice creams and other high-fat foods become popular in Japan, the rate of heart disease and cancer is going up there as well. People are also eating more meat and dairy food in other countries, in which the disease rate is going up along with the change of the way people eat. Doctors everywhere suggest people eat more grains, fruit and vegetables and less meat and dairy food.\nEating healthily is important for children as well as their parents. When parents have poor eating habits, their children usually do, too. After all, children eat the same way as their parents. When parents eat healthy food, the children will learn to enjoy it, too. Then they will develop good eating habits. Doctors suggest parents give their children healthier food such as fruit, vegetables and juice.\nEveryone wants to live a long, healthy life. We know that the food we eat affects (影响)us in different ways. For example, doctors believe that fruit and vegetables can really protect people from many different diseases. On the other hand, animal fat can cause (引起)diseases. We can change our eating habits now and enjoy many years of healthy living.",

The kilt is their national dress and an important part of their tradition.\nA kilt is a colored skirt reaching down to the knees. It has checks(方格)on it with different colors, like red and blue. Each family in Scotland has its own colors.\nHow did the Scots start to wear kilts? There are many stories about it. One story is that the kilt was invented in the 1720s by an English factory owner, Thomas Rawlinson.\nRawlinson had a number of Scottish workers in his factory and he thought their clothing got in the way of their work. So he cut their long clothes into shorter skirts.\nToday, most Scotsmen look the kilt as formal dress. They usually only wear them at weddings or big dinners. There are only a few men who still wear a kilt every day.\nScots also wear kilts in parades(游行队伍)when they play their traditional musical instrument bagpipes. The army still has kilts as the dress uniform(制服), but they no longer use them when fighting.",

They have climbed the highest mountains, traveled into unknown parts of the world or sailed in small boats across the greatest oceans. Now, however, people look for an immediate excitement from a risky(冒险的)activity. It may only last a few minutes or even seconds.\nI think bungee jumping(蹦极跳)is a good example of such an activity. You jump from a high place (perhaps a bridge or a hot-air balloon) 200 meters above the ground with an elastic(有弹性的)rope tied to your ankles(踝骨). You fall at up to 150 kilometers an hour until the rope stops you from hitting the ground. It is said that about 2 million people around the world have now tried bungee jumping.\nWhy do people take part in such activities? Some psychologists(心理学家)say that it is because life in modern societies has become safe and boring. Not very long ago, people's lives were often in danger. They had to go out and hunt for food, diseases could not easily be cured(治愈), and life was a continuous battle for survival(生存).\nNow, according to many people, life offers little excitement. They live and work in safe places. They buy food in shops. There are doctors and hospitals to look after them if they become ill. The answer for some of these people is to look for danger in activities such as bungee jumping.",

There are also too many cars. Tokyo drivers often spend a long time in the busy street, just like drivers in London, Paris and New York.\nTokyo also has a lot of people on foot, and sometimes it is really difficult to walk in the street. The worst time in the street is at 11:30 at night. That is because the nightclubs are closing at that time and everybody wants to go home then. There are 35,000 nightclubs in Tokyo, and usually none of them is empty at night.\nDuring the day, most people go to work by train. Six million train tickets are sold every year in Tokyo. At most stations, trains arrive every two or three minutes, but at certain hours it is not enough at all. Although trains are always crowded, they are very good in many ways. They always leave and arrive on time. In London trains, you may see everybody reading a newspaper. But in Tokyo trains, everybody seems to be sleepy, no matter whether his journey is long or short. If you stand outside the station for five minutes, there will be three fire engines(消防车) going past you. They are on the way to one of the fires that Tokyo has every day. Tokyo has so many surprises that none of them can really surprise me now.",

Westlake College in Virginia (弗吉尼亚) will start a program, which makes it possible for students to do their schoolwork anywhere they want. During five years, each of the 1,500 students at the university will have a laptop. The laptops will connect with the Internet. So the students will be able to use e-mail to \"speak\" with their teachers, their classmates and their families. And the most important part of the laptop program is that the students will be able to use computers without going to computer rooms. They can work with computers at home, in a fast - food restaurant or under the tree- anywhere they want! Because of many changes in computer technology, laptops are very useful in higher education. And as laptops are becoming better and better, they will be able to work as well as desktop computers (台式电脑). What's more, laptops, which can be carried around easily, can connect students to not only Internet, but also libraries and other places. Experts am studying how laptops can help students. They also want to see how the program is working at other universities. At Westlake College, more than 60 percent of the people working there use computers. The laptops will allow all the teachers to use computers in their lessons. As one Westlake teacher said, \"Here we are in the middle of Virginia and we're giving students a window on the world.

See, some of the apples have been bumped (碰撞) and bruised (擦伤)._On the outside, they may not even look as delicious as the others\"_. As I was talking was checking each apple carefully. Then, I took each of the apples and peeled (削) them, putting them back on the table, but in a different place. \"OK, Tim, tell me which one is the red apple, the green apple and the yellow apple\". Tim said, \"I can't. They all look the same now.\" \"Now taste each of them. See if that helps you find out which one is which. Tim did so, and then a big smile came ac. loss his thce. \"People are just like apples! are all different, but if you take off the outside, they're quite the same inside.\" Now I see Tim has already understood me and I don't need to say or do anything else.

They are the well-known Greyhound buses, Greyhound being the name of the company which owns these long-distance buses.\nWhen the summer holidays came near, I asked my American friends what was the best way to travel within the United States. They recommended(建议) Greyhound and explained to me the reason.\nTo fly, of course, is the fastest way, but one can't see anything during a flight except the blue sky and white clouds. So it is not very interesting to one who wants to see the country. Besides, airfare is very expensive.\nTo travel by train is comfortable, because passengers can walk and buy food and drinks on a train. They can also see cities and the countryside through the windows. But not many passenger trains are running. As a result, they don't leave or arrive at a place every day and don't go to many cities.\nTo travel by Greyhound, my friends told me, is easy, cheap and convenient, though not so fast as travelling by plane or so comfortable as by train. You can find Greyhound buses almost in every city, big or small. Moreover, they leave or arrive at a city several times a day, and that makes travel arrangement (安排) easy.\nI took their advice.

L on the left and R on the right. first, hold the card about 80 cm away and you see both the letters. Ther close your right eye and look at the letter R only with your left eye.

Now do the same experiment with your left eye closed, you'll see the letter R disappearing.\nWhy did the letter disappear? It is because there is a blind spot on the eye. When the image (影像) of the letter falls on the blind spot, it won't be seen. That is why either of the letters disappear.",

They also listen to the news about sports, the weather, and the life of American people. Most of the radio programmes are music.\nPop or popular music singers make much money. They make a CD or tape which radio stations use in many places. Once the popular singer is heard all over the country, young people buy his or her tape. Some of the money from these tapes goes to the singer. Wherever the singer goes, all the young people want to meet him or her. Now the singer has become a national star.\nThere are other kinds of music that are important to Americans. One is called folk (民间) music. It tells stories about the common life of Americans. Another is called western or country music. This was started by cowboys (牛仔) who would sing at night to the cows they were watching. Today, any music about country life and the love between a country boy and his girl is called western or country music.",

You can also send flowers before you arrive. you don't usually take wine except when you visit very close friends.\"\n\"We always offer our guests something to drink when they arrive, tea, coffee or perhaps water or soft drinks. We think it is polite to accept a drink even if you're not thirsty. If you visit someone you always stay for a few drinks. When you have had enough to drink, you tap your cup or put your hand over it. If you say no, your host will insist that you have more to drink.\"\n\"People's private lives are very important so they never ask you personal questions about your family or where you live or your job. They never talk about religion or matters of finance, education or politics, but usually stay with safe subjects like the weather, films, plays, books and restaurants.\"\n\"It's difficult to know when to leave, but an evening meal usually lasts about three or four hours. When the host serves coffee, this is sometimes a sign that the evening is nearly over, but you can have as much coffee as you want.\"\n\"If the invitation says eight o'clock then we arrive exactly at eight. With friends we know well, we sometimes arrive about fifteen minutes before.\"\n\"Obviously it depends on the occasion, but most dinner parties are informal.

Hanna changed her name to Anne because she thought it would be easier for people to remember. On the other hand, Joseph is thinking about changing his name to an unusual name because he wants to be different.\nPeople have a lot of reasons for changing their names. Film stars, singers, sportsmen and some other famous people often change their names because they want names that are not ordinary, or that have special sound. They chose the \"new name\" for themselves instead of the name their parents gave them when they were born.\nSome people have another reason for changing their names. They have moved to a new country and want to use a name that is usual there. For example, Li Kaiming changed his name to Ken Lee when he moved to the United States. He uses the name Ken at his job and at school. But with his family and Chinese friends, he uses Li Kaiming. For some people, using different names makes life easier in their new country.\nIn many countries, a woman changes her family name to her husband's after she gets married. But today, many women are keeping their own family name and not using their husband's. Sometimes, women use their own name in some situations (情况)and their husband's in other situations.

He came to China last week for a two-day visit, during which he slept only four hours and had many meetings with government officials(政府官员)and men of business. After all those business matters, he came to Qinghua and was asked thousands of questions from the excited students.\nBallmer, who joined Microsoft in 1980, is the first business manager hired(聘用)by Bill Gates, a schoolmate of Ballmer at Harvard. Gates first dropped out of school to start Microsoft and Ballmer was still studying, but he also gave up his studies and joined Bill Gates' five-year-old Microsoft in 1980.\nIn his talk to the students, Ballmer described what the Internet will bring to their life. He said there are several hundred Qinghua graduates now working or being trained at Microsoft both in China and in the US. He also warned the students not to drop out of school and follow the examples of Bill Gates and himself.",

            "context": "In the summer of 1978 an English man named Steven was driving his tractor through a field of wheat when he discovered something strange. Some of his wheat was lying on the ground. The_flattened wheat_formed(形成)a circle about six meters across. Around this circle were four smaller circles of flattened wheat.\nThree years later a farmer who lived nearby discovered almost the same circles in one of his fields. These circles were larger―nearly 15 meters across. That same year, another English farmer discovered three circles of flattened wheat on his land―one large circle between two small circles. During the following years, farmers in England found circles in their fields more and more often.\nThe circles are called \"crop circles\" because they usually appear in fields of wheat or corn. The wheat in the circles lies on the ground but is never broken; it keeps on growing, and the farmers can later harvest it. Farmers always discover the crop circles in the morning, so the circles probably form at night. They appear only in the months from May to September. What causes the crop circles?\nAt first, people thought that some kids were making them as a joke, or that farmers were making them to attract tourists.(In fact, in 1991, two men said they made the circles themselves, but many scientists don't believe them.) People tried to copy them: They tried to make circles exactly like the ones the farmers had found. They couldn't do it. They couldn't enter a field of wheat without leaving tracks, and they couldn't flatten the wheat without breaking it.\nSeveral times people reported seeing stranger objects near the fields where crop circles later appeared. Many people believe that these crop circles are the messages sent by living things from outer space(外层空间)or the marks left by their spaceships.\nScientists who have studied the crop circles try to find out what causes them. In the summer of 1990 some scientists spent three weeks in the part of England where many circles have appeared. They had all the latest high-tech equipment(最新高科技设备). The equipment―worth 1.8 million dollars―got nothing. But one night, as the scientists were watching a field, crop circles formed in the field behind them, which were quite diferent from the others. The scientists had neither seen nor heard anything.\nWhen Steven discovered the crop circles on his land in 1978, he said, \"It was just like something that had landed in the field from the air and gone back up again. I don't know what to make of these things.\"\nCrop circles have appeared in England, Japan, the United States and Russia. Experts from all over the world have studied them, and they say what Steven said: They don't know what to make of these things.",

A large number of trees are being cut down to make paper. If everyone uses paper carelessly, soon we would not have any trees left. Other things are also being wasted, and people don't know what to do with the waste in big cities. So it is necessary to reduce the amount of waste we produce.\nReuseYou should always think of reusing things before throwing them out. For example, give the clothes you do not use or the ones which are too small to the poor. In a family, you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters.\nRecycleBottles, cans and paper can easily be recycled. By doing so we save lots of time and money. For example, coke cans are sent to a factory, where they are smashed flat and melted. The metal can be used to make new coke cans.\nRecoverWhen you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten ones. You have two choices: one is to throw the apples away, the second is to throw the rotten ones and keep the good ones. In this way, you are recovering the eatable parts of food.\nRepairIf one of the legs of your table is broken, you should repair it. If you want to buy something newer and better, it is better for you to sell the old table, or give it to people who can use it after repairing it.\nLearn the rules to protect our environment. Let's try our best to make the earth cleaner and more beautiful.",

People will come from around the world to watch 10,500 athletes from 205 countries compete to take home the gold. It takes years of work and billions of dollars to prepare for Olympics . But it hasn't always been that way.\nThe ancient Olympics\nThe first recorded Olympics, in 776 B.C., were an important religious festival . But they only included athletes from about a dozen cities. Even after 200 years , the ancient games only included Greek men from about 100 cities around Mediterranean. Unlike today, the ancient games were always at Olympia, in Greece.\nOlympic sports have also changed a lot in the last few thousand years. The ancient games began with just one 192-metre race. In later years , the games grew to include a total of six sports tested skilled soldiers needed. These included races where runners wore fighting equipment and the pankration �C-- a violent sport with few rules.\nThe modern games\nEven the modern Olympics were once far smaller than they are today. The first of the modern games , in 1896, once had 241 athletes from 14 countries. Moreover, the early modern Olympics were not an independent event. Until 1908 the Olympics were part of the world's fair!\nAt the first modern Olympics , there were 43 events from ten sports. Many of the sports from the early modern games are no longer part of the Olympics. These include the sports of golf and tug of war.. There has always been a lot of disagreement over changing Olympic sports.\nThe number of Olympic sports has constantly increased throughout history. At the Beijing games , athletes will compete in 302 events from 28 sports . Despite all the changes over the years , some ancient sports are still part of the modern games . These include running , boxing and wresting.\nThe Olympics continue to grow and change , and they encourage us all to work harder , go faster and be stronger.",

He wanted to find a way to show how this band works with maths. Understand it or not, this band has only one surface . You can find this out for yourself-f. If you draw a line on the surface of the paper before you twist and glue it, the line is only on one side of the paper. The paper has two surfaces. However, if you draw a line after you make the Mobius band, you can follow the line around all sides of the paper. In other words, the Mobius band must have only one surface.\nIt is also very interesting to see what happens when you cut the band. If you cut the Mobius band in half once down the line you drew, you do not get two Mobius bands. Instead, after you cut the band, it turns into one large twisted ring. Then, if you cut this ring in half along the middle of the band again, you get two connected Mobius bands.Try it!",

The main reason for this was because when my mother got married, she didn\"t know how to cook anything, not even an egg. My grandmother never allowed her to stay in the kitchen when she was cooking.\nMy mother did not start to cook until she was 25 years old. In the beginning, it was very hard for her. Therefore, she had to take cooking classes to prepare our meals. After having that experience, she decided to teach me how to cook because she didn\"t want me to have the same experience.\nI remember when I was seven years old, and my mother was cooking, I was with her in the kitchen enjoying cooking. I always helped her. Sometimes we prepared meals that my mother already knew how to make, and sometimes we prepared them from_recipes_. Nowadays, I am really thankful for that experience because I don\"t need help to cook a meal. I can cook for me alone or for a group of people; it doesn\"t matter.\nI will do the same with my children because I don\"t want them to have the same experience as my mother. If one day I am not with them, I want to be sure that they can carry on their lives without me.",

The following experiment shows how easy it was to make a mistake.\nTake three glasses: the first one with very hot water, the second one with very cold water, and the third one with water at room temperature. Then you put a finger of one hand in the hot water, and a finger of the other hand in the cold water. You hold your fingers in the two glasses for a minute. Then you use each finger, one after another, to see how hot or cold the water in the third glass is. You will find that the water is warm to the finger that was in the cold water before, but the finger which was in the hot water will feel cold in the same glass of water.\nThat is why you must always find the temperature in a scientific way. You must not try to tell the temperature as it seems to you.\nYou will often make a mistake if you take something that seems to you for a real fact. For example, when you are going to an Amusement park by bus and you want to get there very quickly, it seems to you that your bus is going very slowly, slower than the other buses.

I like travelling and I have won a free four-week trip to England, but I know little about the British way of life. Would you please write to tell me something about the British meals?\nThank you.\nYours,\nWang Lin\n\nJanuary 1, 2005\nDear Wang Lin,\nIt's very helpful to know something about the British meals before travelling. In many English houses, people eat four meals a day. They are breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner.\nBreakfast takes place at any time from 7:00 to 9:00 in the morning. They usually have eggs, bread with butter(黄油), cheese and so on. English people drink tea or coffee at breakfast. Lunch comes at one o'clock. It can be a hamburger or a three-course (三道菜) meal. Afternoon tea is between 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm. Dinner begins at about half past seven. The first course is soup. The next is often meat or fish with vegetables. Then come fruits of different kinds: apples, pears, bananas and so on. But not all English people eat like that. Some of them have their dinner in the middle of the day. Their meals are breakfast, dinner, tea and supper. And all these meals are usually simple.\nWish you a good time in England!\nYours,\nRose",

Bad things can happen if young people spend too much time on the Internet.\nIn order to help young people use the Internet in a good way, a textbook on good Inter­net behavior has started to be used in some Shanghai middle schools this term. It uses real examples to teach students all about good ways of using the Internet. It gives useful advice such as it's good to read news or find helpful information to study. Some students also make online friends. But if you are meeting a friend offline, let your parents know.\nTeachers and parents all think the book is a very good idea.

We saw the small desk which Shakespeare sat at when he went to school. One of the things we liked best was the garden behind the house, because we could see there many of the flowers, trees and plants Shakespeare wrote about in his plays.\nAfter we had visited Shakespeare's birthplace, we went to see the church where he was buried.\nWe had lunch in the very old hotel that was probably there in Shakespeare's time. Every room of the hotel had the name of one of Shakespeare's plays on the door－the \"Hamlet\" room, the \"Romeo and Juliet\" room, and so on.\nAfter lunch we walked across the fields to the old house, about a mile out of Stratford, where Shakespeare spent most of his married life. The house is just as it was in Shakespeare's day. We saw the chairs where Shakespeare perhaps sat and thought about ideas for new plays, and we saw the plates from which he probably ate his dinner.\nWhen we got back to our hotel in the evening, we were very tired, but each of us had enjoyed a wonderful day.",

Zach was still trying to get along well with Bradley.\nWhen Zach arrived, he asked if Bradley wanted to drive his car. Bradley had a driver's license. Bradley said all right. Zach told him not to drive fast, but that he could drive anywhere he wanted. Bradley got on the road. Zach gave Bradley a few driving tips: Don't drive next to big trucks, because you never know when they might crush(碾压) you. Don't drive behind trucks filled with things, because you never know when something in the truck will fly out and hit your car.\nOn their way back, Zach suggested that they stop at the golf course. He wanted to show Bradley how to play golf. Bradley wasn't interested. He preferred his video games. But Bradley soon discovered that golf was fun! He hit a lot of balls. Zach told him that he was doing well. The next day Bradley, for the first time ever, called Zach. He had a few blisters(水疱) on his hands. Zach said that usually happened. Then Bradley asked if Zach would come next Saturday so they could take a drive and hit golf balls again. Zach said, of course, and felt happy.",

Ebelin is one of them. They have  regular(固定的)backpacks with two straps(带子) to carry them, but a number of students with heavy loads(负担) have_switched to_rolling backpacks. The backpacks have wheels and can roll on the ground. Shirley Park's backpack weighs 10 kilos, and she said, \"I'll change to a rolling backpack because I am starting to have back pain.\"\nHow much is too much? Experts say that students should carry no more than 10% to 15% of their own body weight. A few students have had a good idea to lighten(减轻) the load: less homework.\nDoctor's suggestions:\n⑴ Lighten the load. Take home only the books the students need that day.\n(2) Wide straps are better. They can send out weight over your shoulders (肩)and be sure to wear backpacks with two straps.\n(3) The heaviest things should be packed closest to the back.\n(4) Bend(弯曲) both knees when you pick up the pack, don't just bend over the waist(腰).",

Pamberton, a druggist (药剂师)from Atlanta, had experimented for many months trying to find a cure for the common headache. He worked in his backyard, mixing and heating different mixture of oils and flavors (香料) until he found one that seemed to work well. Pamberton bottled the mixture and began selling it in drugstores as a concentrated syrup (糖浆) that the customer had to mix with water before drinking. The invention of Cola came about quite by accident (偶然). One day, a patient with headache came to a drugstore and asked for a bottle of Cola syrup. He wanted to take it right away. So he asked a shop assistant to mix the medicine while he waited. The shop assistant, instead of walking to the other end of the store to get water, suggested mixing the syrup with soda water (苏打水). \"The patient agreed, and after drinking it, he explained how good it tasted. Then the shop assistant started, selling the mixture and it became popular. Today this kind of Cola is sold in most countries around the world. And although it is no longer the medicine to kill headache, it can still make people feel comfortable and energetic (精力充沛的).",

When she saw an old beggar, she took the cold, rough hands of the woman with her warm, clean hands, and gave the woman some warm bread and helped her put on a pair of new gloves(手套),\nThe woman was surprised for a few seconds, then burst into tears, saying \"for the first_time I feel respected_(尊重)\".\nCai said, \"A beggar's life is very hard. That's why I want to help them.n\nCai was one of 14 Tsinghua students spending Christmas Eve among the poor. They walked in the cold wind along the streets from 4 to 7 p. m. on Friday, visiting 15 beggars in Beijing's Haidian District.\nThey brought bread and gloves with them, and stopped to greet beggars and offer them some of the warm food. Each beggar greeted them with a look of surprise.\n\"1know the activity can't help much, but it's meant to show our respect and care for beggars and the homeless who have been neglected for so long,\" said Sun, head of the group, \"And Christmas is a good time for that. \"",

So I just ended suddenly and soon the students began to pick up their book bags and rushed out the door on their way to another  class.While I was watching them leav-ing, I put away my own books,  notes and papers. I took them up and stepped out into the hall. I was tired and a bit sad. I had put everything I knew into that class and it had not seemed to work. Then, as I started across the hall to  my nearby office, a student came out the back door of the classroom and caught up with me.Randy sat at the back of the classroom. I thought he wanted toask why I didn't correct their exam papers or maybe he wanted to ask for leave or…  It was none of that. With his eyes sparkling(闪烁), Randy said, \"This is the first time I've not wanted a college class to end.\"The tiredness lifted. I had done better than I thought. I don't know if Randy will ever understand how much he did for me that day.",

We learned languages and reading more than sciences and math. Sometimes she taught us herself, but we also had other teachers. They asked us to take lessons every day. About once a week we walked to Golden Gate Park. While we were walking, my mother taught me to read music. One day I noticed a little toy train in the window of a shop and I remember now how I'd like to have it. I couldn't say my 'r' when I was small. My mother said if I could say an 'r' well. I would have the toy train. I practiced and practiced. Then one morning I woke everybody up with my ' r' s. I got the toy train.

You can use it instead of many words such as \"new\" or \"surprising\". Here's an interesting story we can use to show the way the word is used. A teacher asked her students to write about the waterfall(瀑布) they had visited. On one student's paper was Just the one sentence, \"It's so cool. Maybe he thought it was the best way to show what he saw and felt.\nBut the story also shows a scarcity(缺乏) of words. Without \"cool\", some people have no words to show the same meaning. So it is quite important to keep some credibility(可信性). Can you think of many other words that make your life as colourful as the word \"cool\"? I can. And I think they are also very cool.",

Later on Chief Inspector (警官) Roger Fleet said, \"The travellers had a ridio with them. If they had been in trouble, they would have called us.\"\nThe three travellers left Cooktown very early on Saturday morning in aToyota car. They took a small dirt road that runs down to the Daintree River, a dangerous river full of crocodiles (鳄鱼). Chief Inspector Roger Fleet said the tourists wouldn't have got into trouble if they had stayed on the main road.\nA photo of Vicky and Tom was found by a policeman under the \"Be Careful about crocodiles\" sign near the river. Why was the photo left behind? This is just one of the unanswered questions. Other questions are: Why was the photo left behind? Why was theToyotaparked and locked at the edge of the rainforest? The police said that the travellers had left a map of the area behind. Why? Why had someone drawn a cross on the point (地点) where the car is? Is this a sign? What does it mean?

Many people call this plant a tree, but it is a kind of grass.\nLike other kinds of grass, a bamboo plant may be cut very low to the ground, but it will grow back very quickly. A Japanese scientist reported one bamboo plant which grew 1.5 metres (4 feet) in 24 hours! Bamboo grows almost everywhere in the world except Europe. There are more than  1,000 kinds of bamboo.\nNot all bamboo looks the same. Some bamboo plants are very thin. They may only grow to be a few centimetres wide while others may grow to more than 30 centimetres (1 foot) across. This plant also comes in different colours, from yellow to black to green.\nBamboo has been used to make many things such as hats and kitchen tools(厨房用具). Because it is strong, bamboo is also used to build buildings.\nMany Asian countries have used bamboo for hundreds of years. They often use bamboo for buildings and supporting (支撑) new buildings and bridges while they are being built.\nIn Africa, poor farmers are taught how to find water using bamboo. These African countries need cheap way to find water because they have no money, and their fields often die from no rain and no water. Bamboo pipes (管子) help poor farmers bring water to their thirsty fields without spending a lot of money.",

            "context": "Most people around the world are right-handed. This also seems to be true in history. In 1799, scientists studied works (作品) of art made at different times from 1,500 B.C. to the 1950s. Most of the people shown in these works are right-handed, so the scientists guessed that right-handedness has always been common through history. Today, only about 10% to 15% of the   world's population is left-handed.\nWhy are there more right-handed people than left-handed ones? Scientists now know that a person's two hands each have their own jobs. For most people, the left hand is used to find things or hold things. The right hand is used to work with things. This is because of the different work of the two sides of the brain (大脑). The right side of the brain, which makes a person's hands and eyes work together, controls (控制) the left hand. The left-side of the brain, which controls the right hand, is the centre for thinking and doing problems. These findings show that more artists should be left-handed, and studies have found that left-handedness is twice as common among artists than among people in other jobs.\nNo one really knows what makes a person become right-handed instead of left-handed. Scientists have found that almost 40% of the people become left-handed because their main brain is damaged (损害) when they are born. However, this doesn't happen to everyone, so scientists guess there must be another reason (原因) why people become left-handed. One idea is that people usually get right-handed from their parents. If a person does not receive the gene (基因) for right-handedness, he / she may become either right- or left-handed according to the chance (偶然性) and the people they work or live with.\nThough right-handedness is more common than left-handedness, people no longer think left-handed people are strange or unusual. A long time ago, left-handed children were made to use their right hands like other children, but today they don't have to.",

When an animal was killed, its skin was cut off. They wrapped the skin around their bodies. The skins kept them warm. Skins which had fur on them were the best. Even today some people wear the furs of animals to keep them warm.\nAt first men did not know how to make fire. Sometimes a forest was hit by lightning. Then a fire was started. The people took some of this fire to start a fire near their homes. A fire was very important for three reasons. It kept them warm. Wild animals were frightened by it. They did not attack when they saw a fire. Then another thing was discovered. When food was cooked, it tasted much better! But men still did not know how to make fire. When they had a fire, they did not let it stop burning. If it went out, They could not start it again. They had to wait for lightning to start another fire ! Sometimes they had to wait for years!\nLater, they discovered how to make fire. If you rub two pieces of wood together, they become hot and burn. You have to rub very fast ! One way of doing it is to make a little hole in a piece of wood. Little pieces of wood or dry leaves are put into the hole. Then the end of a stick is put into the hole. The stick is rubbed between the hands.\nThis makes it turn very quickly. The end of the stick becomes very hot. The small pieces of wood and dry leaves begin to burn. Another way of making fire is to knock two pieces of stone together. A spark is made. This can be used to start a fire.\nNowadays we have matches. We can carry them in our pockets and make a fire when we want to. Many people use heaters to keep warm. Oil heaters burn oil. Gas heaters burn gas. Electric heaters use electricity. Gas, oil and electricity can also be used for cooking.",

Do you get really shy?\nShyness means feeling nervous or frightened when you're around other people. Experts have found that more than 80 percent of middle school students feel afraid to be the center of attention. Some kids are born shy. Some become shy later because of their life experiences.\nIt's OK if it takes you a while_to feel yourself again_when you go to a new place or meet new people. In fact, everybody gets a little shy sometimes. It's just a case of how much.\nMost people have red faces and talk in broken sentences when they get shy. But some become so shy that they won't go to a restaurant because they are too nervous to order and pay for their food. Some are afraid of meeting new people, so they seldom go outside, This kind of shyness can be bad for a person.\nIf shyness doesn't stop you from doing something you want to do, being shy isn't a very big problem. Some experts say shy people are cleverer because they think more and talk less. Shy people are also good at working with others because they think more for other people.  Some great people in history were shy, too.\nYou see, being shy isn't all bad. But remember not to let good opportunities (机会) pass by just because of it! If you have to sing a song at a birthday party or practice your spoken English in front of others, just do it! There's nothing to be afraid of.",

But it's a good opportunity (机会) for a country to attract tourists and make friends with people from all over the world.\nTwo years ago, cities which were interested in hosting the Olympic Games enrolled (登记) their names. Later they handed in their reports to the IOC (国际 奥委会). Nine cities hoped that they would have the honour (荣誉) .\nOn May 18, 2004, after careful checking of each report, the IOC chose five cities―Paris, London, Moscow, Madrid (马德里) and New York―to be the hopeful cities.\nSince'February, the IOC has visited these five cities to hear each city's report on how they will host the Olympic Games.\nWant to know the result? Some people guess that Paris will be the winner. London and New York could only show plans for gyms (场馆) which will be built for the Olympic Games. But Paris showed its excellent gym that was built for the 1998 Football World Cup.\nBut Paris could have a problem this time. The city ran against Beijing for the 2008 Olympic Games. At that time the IOC members thought that French people were too proud and so they did not win.\nBut don't rush to give an answer. Wait until July 6. On that day in Singapore (新加坡) the IOC will tell the world which city is going to be the next Olympic Games host. Before that, nobody can be sure.",

Loud noise may cause hearing problems for a short time or even for ever.\nThink that earphones are a good way to escape from your parents' eyes?\nWell, it may not be as good a way as you think. American doctors have studied a group of 4 490 people who used earphones more than 15 hours every week. The doctors found that 3 730 of them were getting hearing problems.\nIf you use earphones too long, your ears may feel painful. You may also lose your hearing for the rest (其余的) of your life.\nSo don't wear your earphones too long. Use them less than one hour a day.\nWant good hearing? Don't forget to do the following:\n●Try to stay away from places with too much noise, like a disco. If you have to go, wear earplugs (耳塞).\n●When swimming, remember to put earplugs into your ears to stop water from getting in.\n● Never put anything sharp (尖的) into your ear. If you think you have too much earwax (耳屎) , ask your mum or dad to help you clean it out.\nPlease remember these things! Then you won't be saying \"WHAT???\" when you are older.",

Although he did well, he was never top of his class. After leaving school, Hawking went first to Oxford University where he studied physics, then he went to Cambridge University where he studied cosmology. As he himself admits(承认), he didn't work hard. He was a very lazy student, and did very little work. However, he still got good marks.\nIt was at the age of 20 that Hawking first noticed something was wrong with him. He started to bump (撞上 )into things. When he visited his family at Christmas time, his mother was so worried that she made him see a doctor. Hawking was sent to hospital for tests. Finally, the result came back. Hawking had motor neurone disease, an_incurable_illness which would make him unable to speak, breathe or move without the help of a machine. Doctors said they had no way to help him. He would die before he was 23.\nAt first, Hawking became very sad. After a while, though, he began to see his life in a different way. As he later write, \"Before my illness was diagnosed(诊断), I had been very bored with life. There bad not seemed to be anything worth doing. But shortly after I came out of hospital, I suddenly realized that there were a lot of worthwhile things I could do.\" Hawking married, found a job at Cambridge University, and had three children. He also went on to do some of the most important scientific research.\nToday, Hawking still works at Cambridge University as a professor. He strongly believes that his story shows that nobody, however bad their situation(处境) is, should lose hope. \"Life is not fair, \"he once said. \"You just have to do the best you can in your own situation.\"",

            "context": "It is sometimes said that the English are polite people. This can make life difficult for foreigners. Suppose a foreign boy asks an English girl to go out with him and she says, \"If I finish my work, I'll meet you in the cafe at 7 o'clock.\" Is she saying \"yes\" or \"no\" to his invitation?\nIn grammatical terms, she is using the conditional structure(表示条件的句式). By using the conditional, speakers of English can avoid (避免) giving a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to a question. It enables people to be diplomatic(婉转的). If the girl doesn't want to go out with the boy, she won't appear at the cafe. She will let him understand she is still working. If she wants to go out with him, but doesn't want to appear too easy to catch, she has achieved (达到) that with her reply. Here she uses the first conditional which shows probability, it seems that she will go to the cafe. Being polite can make life very difficult!\nThe conditional is often used by people like politicians(政客), for example--who wish to avoid speaking out their ideas. This is very important if they are on their way to discuss an agreement. No one wants to give away his or her points before he or she starts. A government spokesman might say to a group of workers, \"If we could pay you more, we would.\" The use of the conditional here makes room for argument although the speaker is using the second conditional form, which shows improbability. So it is unlikely the workers will get their rise.\n\"If\" is a small word, which often appears in the English language. It can show politeness, reported speech and conditionals such as the First---probability---if I can come to your party, I will; the Second---improbability---if I saw you tomorrow, I'd give you the book; and the Third---impossibility (meaning it is too late to change something that has happened)--if you have told me, I would have helped you.",

One of the biggest disadvantages for most musicians is that they don't always have enough money. Most of the time, you will be looking for jobs. Sometimes you won't be able to find a good job. Another disadvantage is the place you live in. If you want to be a musician, you usually have to move to an area that has a lot of jobs, such as New York City. The cost of living in these areas is usually very high. The third disadvantage is that you can't have a_stable_family life.

But I will always be American.\nSan Francisco, like London, has many parks. Every day my sisters and I were taken to play in the parks as children. I didn't go to school. I only had three hours of formal education when I was five. I was sent to school in the morning but came home at noon on the first day. I said I didn't enjoy it and hadn't learned anything. My parents thought that school was unsuitable for me. They agreed with me, so I never went back to school.\nThen my mother taught me and my two sisters at home, in the way of an English lady who had good education. We learned languages and reading more than sciences and maths. Sometimes she taught us herself, but we also had other teachers. They asked us to take lessons every day. About once a week we walked to Golden Gate Park. While we were walking, my mother taught me to read music. One day I noticed a little toy train in the window of a shop and I remember now how I'd like to have it. I couldn't say \"r\" when I was small. My mother said if I could say an \"r\" well, I would have the toy train. I practiced and practiced. Then one morning I woke everybody up with my \"r\"s. I got the toy train.

Colours in them seem to be used mainly to protect themselves.Some birds like eating locusts. but birds cannot easily catch them. Why? It is because locusts change their colours together with the change of the colours of crops. When crops are green, locusts look green. But as the harvest time comes, locusts change to the same brown colour as crops have. Some other pests with different colours from plants are easily found and eaten by others. So they have to hide themselves for lives and appear only at night.If you study the animal life, you'll find the main use of colouring is protecting themselves. Bears, lions and other animals move quietly through forests. They cannot be seen by hunters. This is because they have the colours much like the tree.\nHave you ever noticed an even more strange act? A kind of fish in the sea can send out a kind of very black liquid when it faces danger. While the liquid spread over, the enemies cannot find it. And it immediately swims away. So it has lived up to now though it isn't strong at all.",

It was tied tightly (紧紧地) over the stomach, which was not really fat. \"I have the rest of the two ducks here,\" he said. With these words, he got off the train.

He had no schooling, for being so poor, how could they afford school fees?\nWhen he was fifteen, he worked as a servant in a school. Looking at other children studying in the classroom, he felt sorry for himself. In the day time, after the sweeping and cleaning was over, he could stand by the window outside the classroom trying to_catch_what the teacher said. At night, he tried his best to remember what he learned during the day. He worked so hard at the lesson that he sometimes had just three or four hours' sleep. The more he learned, the greater interest he had. A maths teacher discovered him and came to like this diligent (勤奋的) boy and allowed him to sit at the back of the class. In one exam, he came first in grade in the whole school. He would have been given the scholarship if he had been a regular boy of the school.\nRobinson struggled through six long years with his study of maths and wrote several articles which caught the attention of some university professors. They appreciated (欣赏)his diligence as well as his cleverness. To give him the better chance they hired him as a librarian (图书管理员)and offered him free guidance. Robinson was filled with joy, for he felt that before him there was a broad road leading to success. (264 w)",

I can repeat every word you just said!\" It doesn't seem to be good enough.\n\"No,\" she says, \"you don't listen.\"\nWhat's wrong? Scientists tell us that words give us only 35 percent of what we mean. The rest? Body language. In other words, you may hear the words but not the \"tune\".\nBody language. You know about the hitchhiker's thumb. That sign is clear. But what is the sign for a pretty girl? An Arab strokes his beard (捋胡须). An Italian pulls on one of his ear lobes (耳垂). An Englishman looks slowly away.\nBody language, if you look for it, is all over the place.\nWhen two people like each other, they show it. They hold their bodies straighter. Eyes are bright. Skin may be pinker. And each preens. The girl works with her hair. The boy combs his hair, straightens his tie �C or his shirt �C and pulls up his socks.\nWhen you are looking at the other person, you show interest. When you fail to make eye contact, you give the impression that the other person is of no importance.\nWords are only part of talking. The rest takes in body movements, dress, eye contact, and, of course, the tone of the voice. Recently I went to a meeting of some teachers. Two teachers were arguing. What the lady was saying was polite enough. Her voice, though, gave her away. It kept getting higher and angrier by the minute. She was saying �C in words �C that there were two sides to the matter. But what she was really saying �C with her tone of voice �C was \"I hate you!\" When the man told her that she was showing anger by her voice �C and her whole body �C she did not agree. She was not aware of her real feelings. But her body language told the story.\n315w",

Man can only drink or use the other 3% of the fresh water which comes from rivers, lakes and underground. On the other hand, because the number of people in the world is becoming larger and larger, more and more fresh water is needed. So water shortage (短缺) becomes a big problem.\nHow can we work out this problem? Scientists have found some ways to turn salt water into fresh water. One important way is to boil (使达到沸点) sea water with high heat until vapor (蒸汽) rises, leaving the salt. In this way, a lot of fresh water can be made quickly.\nBut heating is not the only way to get fresh water. Other ways are tried, for example, digging deep wells, keeping rain water and stopping rivers from becoming dirty.\nWhich way is the best?

Mother's Day falls on the second Sunday in May. On that day, many people send gifts of love to their mothers. Those whose mothers are still living often wear a pink or red rose or carnation (康乃馨), while those whose mothers are dead wear a white one.\nThe idea of a day for mothers was first given by Miss Anna Jarvis of Philadelphia. As a result of her hard work, the celebration of the first American Mother's Day was held in Philadelphia on May 10, 1908. Soon the holiday became popular all over the country and around the world.\nIn China, many people do the same on the day for mothers nowadays. And in some cities people sometimes ask a song to be broadcast (广播) for his or her mother only. This might cost a little money for some of them, but as it is said,\"Love is invaluable\".\nOn May 8, 1999, just the day before the Mother's Day that year, a Chinese mother was killed in a criminal bombing (罪恶的轰炸).

Foods are cooked and eaten in many different kinds of ways. People in different countries eat at different times of the day. In some places people eat once or twice a day; in other countries people eat three or four times a day. Scientists say that none of the differences is really important. It doesn't matter whether foods are eaten raw (生的)or cooked, canned or frozen. It doesn't matter if a person eats dinner at 4 o'clock in the afternoon or at eleven o'clock at night. The important thing is what you eat every day.\nParagraph 3\nThere are two problems, then , in feeding the large number of people on earth. The first is to find some way to feed the world's population so that no one is hungry. The second is to make sure that people everywhere have the right kinds of food to make them grow to be strong and healthy.",

Before the Second World War people usually learned a foreign language in order to read the literature(文学)of the country. Now speaking the foreign language is what most people want. Every year many millions of people start learning one. How do they do it?\nSome people try at home, with books and tapes; some use radio or television programmes; others go to evening classes. If they use the language only two or three times a week, learning it will take a long time, like language learning at school. A few people try to learn a language fast by studying for six or more hours a day. It is clearly easier to learn the language in the country where it is spoken. However, most people cannot afford this, and for many it is not necessary. They need the language in order to do their work better. For example, scientists and doctors mainly need to be able to read books and reports in the foreign language. Whether the language is learned quickly or slowly, it is hard work. Machines and good books will help, but they cannot do the students work for him.",

We had hoped for a nice holiday from our busy work lives, and your advertisement said \"comfortable and quiet\". We want to have a chance to enjoy ourselves. However, we were always waken up by the noise every morning. Is it really necessary for the workers to start their repair work so early?\n2. We had hoped to swim in your \"wonderful pool\". To our disappointment(失望), we found that it was closed for the whole time of our stay.\nI hope you do not mind my writing to you about these things, but I would be happy if you could give me some explanation. As I said at the start, it is a pity, and your service is so good in other fields.\nI hope to hear from you soon.\nYours sincerely\nMr Hector Bradley",

He became an Olympic \"dark horse\" last Thursday by winning the gold medal in men's freestyle aerial skiing(自由式滑雪空中技巧) at Turin in Italy. He made two almost perfect jumps for the highest score. Han had never won a world gold medal before, let alone(更不用说) in the Olympics!\n\"I never thought this would happen,\" said the 23-year-old. \"I feel like I'm in a dream.\" It's China's second gold medal at the Turin Olympics. But more important, Han's gold was the country's first ever in a snow sport. In 2002, China's Yang Yang won the gold for speed skating at the winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, US.\nJust because Han's win was unexpected doesn't mean that he didn't work hard.\nHan grew up in Jiangsu Province. Before he started his training on snow, he used to be an acrobat(杂技演员) at a circus. In 1995, a coach found his talent(才能). The coach, Yang Er'qi, said Han had the agility(灵活性) and courage to be a ski jumper. When Yang first took the 12-year-old to northern China, the boy couldn't swim, skate or ski. But he wasn't afraid of the high platform(跳台) and kept on training.\nHan almost left the sport after hurting his knee months before the Salt Lake Games. In that Olympics he only got 24th. \"I was hopeless at that time, but my family and the coach stood firmly(坚强地) behind me, helping me through,\" he recalled.\nHan Xiaopeng worked so hard that he won the gold medal in the Olympics at last. Because of his success, more and more people in China are becoming interested in skiing. We are proud of him and we hope he will have another big success in the next winter Olympics.",

Their brain(大脑)is as big as men's and they live a long life---- at least 20 or 30 years.\nLike some animals, dolphins use sounds to help them find their way around. They also use these sounds to talk to each other and help them find food. They do not use their ears to receive sounds, but use the jaw--- the lower part of the mouth.\nIt is strange that dolphins are friendly to men, and for thousands of years, there are many stories about dolphins and men. In the 19thcentury, in a dangerous part of the sea near New Zealand, there was a dolphin. The seamen liked him very much and gave him a very good name, Jack. From 1871 to 1903, Jack met every boat in the area and showed it the way. In 1903 a passenger on a boat with the name of The Penguin shot and hurt Jack. Luckily the dolphin didn't die, and after a long time he was well again. He guided the ships through the area for nine more years, but he refused to help the boat The Penguin.\nToday, some people still kill dolphins, but many countries in the world now protect them. In these places, people are not allowed to kill them.",

Then in a low voice he said to his dog!\" Tige raised its ears as if it understood.\n\"Uhum! Even a dog likes it!\" he said, \"Well, Tige, I won't say unkind words to you any more.\" Tige waved its tail happily.\nThe boy thought and thought. Finally he looked at himself in the river. He saw a clean nice boy. He was amazed. From then on, he had a new life.\nAfter telling this, the businessman stopped for a while, and then he said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the very place where that kind woman planted in me the first seed(种子) of kindness.

That year, Daguere, another Frenchman, took a picture of his reading room. He used a new kind of camera in a different way. In his picture you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest thing. This kind of photo was called a Daguerreotype.\nSoon, other people began to use Daguerre's way. Travelers brought back wonderful photos from all around the world. people took picture of famous buildings, cities and mountains.\nIn about 1840, photography was developed. Then photographers could take picture of people and moving things. That was not simple. The photographers had to carry a lot of film and other machines. But this did not stop them, for example, some in the United States worked so hard.\nMathew Brady was a famous American photographers. He took many picture of great people. The picture were unusual because they were very lifelike(栩栩如生的)\nPhotographers also became one kind of art by the end of the 19th century. Some photos were not just copies of the real world.

They had a big balloon and they were ready for a long way.\nSoon they heard the sea. They were carrying the usual rope(绳子),and it was hanging down from the basket of the balloon. At the end of the rope they had tied a metal box. This could hold water, or it could be empty. So they were able to change its weight(重量).It was for use over the sea. They were also carrying some bags of sand.\nAfter the sun rose, the balloon went higher. It went up to 3,000 metres, and the air was very cold. The water in the balloon became ice. Snow fell past the men's basket, and they could see more snow on the ground. The men tried to throw out some more sand; but it was hard. They tried to break the icy sand with their knives, but it was not easy. The work was slow and they were still falling, so they had to drop some whole bags of sand. One of them fell on an icy lake and made a black hole in the ice\nAt last they pulled the box into the basket. It was still snowing; so they climbed to get away from the snow. They rose to 5,100 metres! Everything became icy. They were so cold that they decided to land. They came down in Poland heavily but safely. They had travelled 1,797 kilometers from London!",

Much of that trash will be there for hundreds of years. The dumps will be filled up with all this trash.\nThere are three ways to cut down on trash.\nOne way is to recycle. When you recycle something, it means it is made into another shape and used again. Old newspaper may become paper bags. A glass jar can be melted (熔化) and made into a bottle .\nAnother way to cut down on trash is to reuse things. You can wash and use again a bottle that can hold mustard (芥末酱) or something else .\nThe third way to cut down on trash is to reduce the amount of trash you make, stop buying thing that you don't need in the first place.

Now do the same experiment with your left eye closed, you'll find the letter R disappearing.\nWhy does the letter disappear? It is because there is a blind spot on the eye.

People in these states have more heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March.\nThe weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 report by scientists, IQ (智商) of a group students were very high when a very strong wind came, but after the strong wind, their IQ was 10% below. The wind can help people have more intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand (另一方面), can make it lower. Students in many schools of the United States often get worse on exams in the hot months of the year (July and August).\nWeather also has a strong influence on people's feelings. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel unhappy during cold weather. But fat people may have a hard time in hot summer. At about 18C, people become stronger.\nLow air pressure (气压) may make people forgetful. People leave more bags on buses and in shops on low-pressure days. There are a \"good weather\" for word and health. People feel best at a temperature of about 18 centigrade (摄氏度).\nAre you feeling sad, tired, forgetful, or unhappy today?

From the pictures, the scientists can often say how the weather will change.\nToday, nearly five hundred weather stations in sixty countries receive satellite pictures.When they receive new pictures, the meteorologists compare them with earlier ones. Perhaps they may find that the clouds have changed during the last few hours. This may mean that the weather on the ground may soon change, too. In their next weather forecast, the meteorologists can say this.\nSo the weather satellites are a great help to the meteorologists. Before satellites were invented, the scientists could forecast the weather for about 24or 48 hours. Now they can make good forecasts for three or five days. Soon, perhaps, they may be able to forecast the weather for a week or more ahead (提前).",

They say that there are several kinds of food that people should eat every day, they are: (1) green and yellow vegetables of all kinds; (2) citrus (柑桔) fruits and tomatoes; (3) potatoes and other fruits and vegetables; 94) meat of all kinds, fish and eggs; (5) milk and foods made from milk; (6) bread or cereal (谷类), rice is also in this kind of food; (7) butter, or something like butter.\nParagraph 2\nPeople in different countries and different places of the world eat different kinds of things. Foods are cooked and eaten in many different kinds of ways. People in different countries eat at different times of the day. In some places people eat once or twice a day; in other countries people eat three or four times a day. Scientists say that none of the differences is really important. It doesn't matter whether foods are eaten raw or cooked, canned (罐装的) or frozen (冷冻的). It doesn't matter if a person eats dinner at 4 o'clock in the afternoon or at eleven o'clock at night. The important thing is what you eat every day.\nParagraph 3\nThere are two problems, then, in feeding the large number of people on the earth. The first is to find some way to feed the world's population so that no one is hungry. The second is to make sure that people everywhere have the right kinds of food to make them grow to be strong and healthy.",

But perhaps eight percent are quite happy with 5 hours or less, and four percent or so find that they want ten hours or more. If you feel all right, you're probably getting enough sleep. The important thing is not to worry how much other people get―their needs may be different. Exercise doesn't seem to increase the need for sleep―office workers, for example, sleep for about as long as people doing physically active work.\nChildren sleep more than grown-ups―perhaps 14 to 18 hours soon after birth, going down to grown-up levels by early teenage (青少年).

After she left school, her first job was to take care of the children of a rich family in Belgium(比利时). The language they spoke was French, so she found that her school studies were useful. She could understand them easily, at the same time she taught the children to speak English and play the piano.\nAfter hearing that her father was seriously ill, Edith returned home to look after him. She then decided to become a nurse. Afterwards for five years she worked in an English hospital where she proved to be highly professional(专业的)at her job. A Belgian doctor was so impressed(印象深的)that he invited her to his country to organize a training school for nurses. The First World War (第一次世界大战) broke out in 1914 and Edith Cavell's school of nursing became a hospital. She stayed there to look after the sick and wounded soldiers (伤员). Edith treated them with kindness. Between November 1914 and August 1915 she secretly helped about 200 wounded soldiers and prisoners (囚犯) escape from the Germans. Later the German army found out what Edith had done and they arrested her. Finally, the Germans killed her, but they could not_kill her memory_. A tall statue(雕塑)has been built in Trafalgar Square, London, in honor(纪念)of the brave English nurse.",

Nancy is a detective (侦探) who has many fantastic ideas! I love it because it's a book from when my grandma was my age, and I can share the fun with her!\nI highly recommendSkinny Bonesby Barbara Park. It is funny so please add it on your book list. You don't want to miss out funny stories!\nI would suggest <blank> by Judy Blume. It is based on real things that happened to Judy Blume. It is about a girl, Alice, who meets some girls at a new state. They become friends, make a club and meet once a week. They stop after two weeks because they all like a boy in their class and put him as number one. I think every girl should read this because it is about our growing up.\nI read a book calledNeela: Victory Songand it was so good I read it twice! It takes place in India in 1936 and this 12-year-old girl named Neela tries to save her father! It has lots of history in it! I also learned a lot about different cultures!

Courage is challenging yourself to do something even though you think it might be hard. For each promise, find out two or three ways to help you keep it. For example, if you think thatBeing Honestis the hardest promise for you to keep, one of the ways might be \"Tell people about my promise so that I won't break it\".\nPart 3: Confidence\nConfidence is believing that you have the skills to do something.

Once you've decided what your special skill is, think about how you can use your skill to make your corner of the world a better place.

Then the system will drop some cleaner on the floor and an arm will mop(用拖把擦)it up. \"This may trouble you,\" says Kara, an expert in Mason's company. \"But you can program it to come on at 3 a. m., and it will just wet-mop the floor for you.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the kitchen, Bruce Beihoff, another expert at Whirlpool, is sure that in a few years, robots will be doing most of the boring work, freeing us to relax. \"More than just fun, future kitchens will be environmentally friendly,\" he says. \"A new system will be built in the house which can recycle energy(能量)lost from your kitchen to make the whole home warm.\"\n\"The fridge will be the center of the home,\" says Daniel Lee, a market expert.

We can only make a guess, of course, but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today. For man is slowly changing all the time.\nLet us take an example. Man, even five hundred years ago, was shorter than he is today. Now, on the average, men are about three inches taller. Five hundred years is a relatively(相对地) short period of time, so we may suppose that man will continue to grow taller.\nAgain, in the modern world we use our brains a great deal. Even so, we still make use of only about 20% of the brain's capacity(容量.) As time goes on, however, we shall have to use our brains more and more and finally we shall need larger ones! This is likely to bring about a physical change too. The head, especially the forehead, will grow larger.\nNowadays our eyes are being used too much. In fact, we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over a very long period of time it is likely that man's eyes will grow stronger.\nOn the other hand, we tend (有…的趋势) to make less use of our arms and legs. These, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however, our fingers will grow more sensitive(敏感的)because they are used a great deal in modern life.\nBut what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body altogether in course of time because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer. In the future, then, both men and women are probably to be hairless!\nPerhaps, all this gives the impression that future man will not be a very attractive (有吸引力的) person to look at! This may well be true. All the same, besides these changes, future man will still have a lot in common with us. He will still be a human being, with thoughts and feelings similar to our own.",

Ever since I was only a few years old, horses have been my passion (酷爱之物). My dream was to ride a horse. When that time finally came near my anxious little life, my heart beat a thousand times a minute.\nIt was a warm summer day in Odessa, Ukraine, and we were at a park. My mom was buying several things for home while I looked around to find something that made my eyes twinkle (shine). I saw a figure from heaven, a four-legged beautiful animal was standing down the block, breathing heavily. I ran up to the horse, not even knowing how to pet it, just excited to see the most beautiful animal. He was shining white, with a well-brushed tail.\nRight away I thought that I could ride this horse. I turned the other way and went to search for my mom to get some money. I saw her buying groceries and led her to where the horse was. The owner was back and said that it was his horse and I couldn't ride it. A warm stream of tears (眼泪) flooded down my cheeks as my mom tried to ask the man to let me ride the horse. He finally agreed for a high price. He taught me how to get on the horse and explained to me that it was important to keep heels down and arms steady. The beat of the horse's trot (小跑) awakened all the senses in me and I knew I was the happiest little girl in Ukraine at that time. I began planning how I was going to buy a horse after I became a millionaire. Before I knew it, the ride was over. Surprisingly, I actually learned to control the horse.\nThat day was probably the happiest time of my life. Most children wouldn't have as much fun as I did. Several years later, after coming to America, I began to take part in show jumping. If it weren't for that time in Ukraine, I wouldn't be able to enjoy the most amazing(令人惊叹的) sport, one where you and another animal truly have to_bond_.",

Their duty is to look after their families and do all the housework. They can't find work outside. When they go out in public, they cover their faces with something and walk behind their husbands.\nFor the past few years the women's life has been changing in those countries.

            "context": "Without goals, life is meaningless. Goals provide the direction in life. It is always wondered why some people cannot see the importance of goals, the need to set goals and follow them through. Very few people would get on a plane or a ship, not knowing where they were traveling to. Goals are the aim for striving (奋斗目标) and those who walk about without plans through life waste a great deal of time.\nGoal setting has long been thought to be necessary in business and more recently many people have come to think highly of some of the great people in the world - people who set simple goals and who go after them - such as Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa and Michael Jordan.\nFor personal development, the starting point is setting goals. Sometimes the starting point is dreaming, having wishes, then breaking their big plan into small ones that can be achieved (实现). A useful idea is to think about what you would really like to achieve, what you will be in the future - five years from now, ten years from now. Writing these down is a good starting point.\nIt is always wise to break goals up into short-term and long-term goals. Knowing that something is achievable soon can give more confidence to achieve._Long-term goals will probably be fewer , but short-term goals can fall into a \"more possible to achieve\" basket ._\nGoals need to be started with clearness. The clearer they are, the easier they are to reach. If a goal is shown clearly, it can guide to a fitting action. It is important that a person never loses sight of their goals. To do so is to become aimless and off track. It is sometimes useful to question yourself. \"How important is this goal to me?\" If the answer is \"I think it is very important \", then it must be followed. That means that action must be taken at once.\nDelay (拖延) is the thief (贼) of time for human. The longer you delay, the more difficult it is to achieve goals. There are many people who probably have less skill (技能), even less education than you, yet they succeed.

Don't reach for a coffee! Instead, take a nap.\nIt's good to have a daily nap. First of all , you are more efficient(有效的) after napping . You remember things better and make fewer mistakes. Also, you can learn things more easily after taking a nap. A nap may increase your self-confidence(自信) and make you more active . It may even cheer you up. But, there are some simple rules you should follow about taking a nap. First, take a nap in the middle of day, about eight hours after you wake up. Next, a 20-minute nap is best. If you sleep longer, you may fall into a deep sleep. After waking from a deep sleep, you will feel worse. Also, you should set an alarm clock. That way, you can fully relax during your nap. You won't have to keep looking at the clock so you don't oversleep.\nNow, the next time you feel sleepy after lunch , don't get stressed . Put your head down, close your eyes, and catch forty winks.",

They got up when the sun came up and worked in the fields until the sun went down.\nMan-made things\nThe sand clock is made of two glass balls joined by a narrow neck. The top ball was filled with sand. The sand slowly moved through the neck into the bottom (底部) ball. People knew how much time had passed when all the sand had fallen to the bottom ball.\nPeople also made the water clock. They made a small hole near the bottom of a pot. Then they filled the pot with water. Markings inside the pot showed how much time passed as the water dripped (滴) out of the hole.\nNature's Clocks in Living Things\nAnimals' Body Clock\nAnimals do not need clocks to know time.

Your roommates, as grown-ups, can do whatever they want with their time so long as it doesn't break school rules or violate(防碍) other people's interests.\nPlaying perhaps gives these students relaxation(放松) from hard study. If they play too often, have little time to study, and they will_reap what they have sown_, but you will not. Reporting to the teachers would only harm your good name in your dormitory(宿舍). However you have rights to ask your roommates to be quiet when you need sleep. If they aren't angry with you, they will stop talking. But be polite and friendly.

They had a big balloon and they were ready for a long way.Soon they heard the sea. They were carrying the usual rope(绳子),and it was hanging down from the basket of the balloon. At the end of the rope they had tied a metal box. This could hold water, or it could be empty. So they were able to change its weight(重量).It was for use over the sea. They were also carrying some bags of sand.After the sun rose, the balloon went higher. It went up to 3,000 metres, and the air was very cold. The water in the balloon became ice. Snow fell past the men's basket, and they could see more snow on the ground. The men tried to throw out some more sand; but it was hard. They tried to break the icy sand with their knives, but it was not easy. The work was slow and they were still falling, so they had to drop some whole bags of sand. One of them fell on an icy lake and made a black hole in the ice.At last they pulled the box into the basket. It was still snowing; so they climbed to get away from the snow. They rose to 5,100 metres! Everything became icy. They were so cold that they decided to land. They came down in Poland heavily but safely. They had travelled 1,797 kilometres from London!",

The following experiment shows how easy it was to make a mistake.\nTake three glasses; the first one with very hot water, the second one with very cold water, and the third one with water at room temperature. Then you put a finger of one hand in the hot water, and a finger of the other hand in the cold water. You hold your fingers in the two glasses for a minute. Then you use each finger, one after another, to see how hot or cold the water in the third glass is. You will find that the water is warm to the finger that was in the cold water before, but the finger which was in the hot water will feel cold in the same glass of water.\nThat is why you must always find the temperature in a scientific way. You must not try to tell the temperature as it seems to you.\nYou will often make a mistake if you take something that seems to you for a real fact. For example, when you are going to an Amusement park by bus and you want to get there very quickly, it seems to you that your bus is going very slowly, slower than the other buses. But if it is Sunday and you have much free time, it seems to you all the buses and cars are going very fast.",

I worked quite hard and made good progress(取得进步).\nI spent the afternoon outside. I went to swim and it was funny. I would not go home until it was about five or six o'clock. Sometimes a friend of mine would come to see me and we would spend some hours listening to music.\nIn this way I spent my vacation happily. And I not only studied well but also became a good swimmer.

Soon the passengers stepped into the plane and it took off. A little girl called Mary took out a whistle(哨子) and began playing herself a happy tune. But none of the other passengers liked the music. They complained to the hostess, who asked Mary to stop.\nThe sound of the plane's engine woke up the snake. It stuck its head out and looked around the captain's room. The captain saw the snake and was nearly frightened out of his life. He was so afraid of being bitten that he could not control the plane, which started to swing dangerously from side to side. The hostess told the passengers what was happening and asked them to clam down. Mary was not afraid. She ran to the captain's room with her whistle and began to a slow tune. Immediately the snake followed her. The girl returned to her seat and the snake lay on the floor beside her, swaying (摇摆) to the music.\nWhen the plane finally landed at the airport the snake was taken away in a net. From then on Mary often went to visit the snake in a zoo near her house.",

No. They are\njust Chinese people like you and me.\nABC means American-born Chinese. An ABC is a Chinese, but was born in the United States. Sometimes, people call an ABC a \"banana person\". A banana is yellow outside and white inside. So, when a person is a banana, he or she is white inside ― thinking like a Westerner and yellow outside ― looking like a Chinese.\nDo you know why? Usually, ABCs know little about China or the Chinese language. Some of them don't speak Chinese. Also, they are not interested in Chinese politics .But if ABCs cannot speak Chinese, can we still call them Chinese people? Yes, of course. They are Chinese. They are overseas Chinese. These people may be citizens of another country like the US, Canada or Singapore. But they have Chinese_blood__._Their parents, grandparents or even great-grandparents were from China. They all have black eyes and black hair.\nBut they are not Chinese citizens. They are not people of the People's Republic of China. For example, we all know the famous scientist C. N. Yang (杨振宁).

After about a week, the rice becomes rice brew.\"Our brew looks so delicious. I couldn't wait to taste it!\" said Xi Yiwen, a 14-year-old girl. But Xi had to wait because they had to eat it at the \"tasting party\". During the party, the teacher heated up each group's rice brew for everyone to taste. The students then chose one group as the best brew maker.Some group's brew was popular and soon eaten up but some was sour and tasted terrible! Some students even bought new brew because they failed to make their own.\"Working together brought us happiness no matter what the result was!\" said Wang Yajun, a 15-year-old girl.

People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in those states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March.\nThe weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can decrease(减少) it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly in exams in the hot months of the year (July and August ).\nWeather also has a strong effect on people's feeling. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65F, people become stronger.\nLow air pressure (气压) makes people feel free, but it also increases forgetfulness. People leave more bags and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low pressure days. There is a \"perfect weather\" for work and health. People feel best at a temperature of about 64F with 65 percent humidity (湿度).\nAre you feeling sick, sad, tired, forgetful, or very intelligent today? The weather may be the reason.",

In a number of European countries, people can turn on their TVs and shop for clothes, jewelry, food, toys, and many other things.\nTeleshopping is becoming popular in Sweden, for example. The biggest Swedish company sells different kinds of things on TV in 15 European countries, and in one year it made $100 million. In France there are two teleshopping channels, and the French spend about $20 million a year to buy things through those channels.\nIn Germany, until last year teleshopping was only possible on one channel for 1 hour every day. Then the government allowed  more teleshopping. Other channels can open for teleshopping company and a 24hour teleshopping company. German businesses are hoping this new teleshopping will help them sell more things.\nSome people like teleshopping because it allows them to do their shopping without leaving their homes. With all the problems of traffic in the cities, this is an important reason. But at the same time, other Europeans do not like this new way of shopping. They call teleshopping \"junk (垃圾) on the air\". Many Europeans usually worry about the quality (质量) of the things for sale on TV. Good quality is important to them, and they believe they cannot be sure about the quality of the things on TV.\nThe need for high quality means that European teleshopping companies will have to be different from the American companies. They will have to be more careful about the quality of the things they sell. They will also have to work harder to sell things that the buyers cannot touch or see in person.",

He shows a hard floor cleaning system(系统)that's built into the wall: it will blow dirt to a part of the room where it will be collected by a vacuum(吸尘器). Then the system will drop some cleaner on the floor and an arm will mop(用拖把擦)it up. \"This may trouble you,\" says Kara, an expert in Mason's company. \"But you can program it to come on at 3 a. m., and it will just wet-mop the floor for you.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the kitchen, Bruce Beihoff, another expert at Whirlpool, is sure that in a few years, robots will be doing most of the boring work, freeing us to relax. \"More than just fun, future kitchens will be environmentally friendly,\" he says. \"A new system will be built in the house which can recycle energy(能量)lost from your kitchen to make the whole home warm.\"\n\"The fridge will be the center of the home,\" says Daniel Lee, a market expert. The fridge will have a touch screen (触摸屏幕)where you can watch TV, surf the Internet, check your e-mail, keep a shopping list and order vegetables. \"Your fridge is the first place you go in the morning and the last place at night,\" says Lee.\nEver wonder why a 1.9-meter man and a 1.6-meter woman have to cook meals on counters(工作台)of the same height. \"The height was decided over 50 years ago, according to the height of ordinary women,\" says Jane Langmuir, an expert of cooking machines. \"But times have changed. We have made a new counter where you press a button and it moves to whatever height you want.\" At the same time, Ted Selker at MIT's Counter lab has made the Dishmaker which lets you make dishes and bowls out of plastics at home. After each meal, the dishes are changed straight back into plastics.",

Many guests like the idea because they don't have to bring their own. But, if you travel to Beijing, remember to bring your own things. Starting from June, some hotels in Beijing will no longer provide guests with these disposables. They want to ask people to use less disposable things.\nMany disposable things are made of plastic. People throw them away after only using them once. It is a waste of natural resources (资源) and is very bad for the environment. Do you know, one Chinese person makes as much as 400kg of waste a year! Most of that waste comes from disposable things. In Beijing, people throw away about 19,000 tons of plastic bags and 1,320 tons of plastic lunch bowls every year! Plastic can take between 100 and 400 years to break down. So the less plastic we throw out, the better. So, wherever you travel, bring your own things and use them again and again.\nBack at home and school, you can also do something to make our world a better place. Try to do these things in your daily life: Use cloth shopping bags, not plastic ones. After using a plastic bag, wash it out and let it dry. Then you can use it over and over again. Do not use paper cups. At your school canteen(食堂), use your own bowl and chopsticks instead of disposable ones.",

Just send…\" and so on? Of course, it never happens quite like that. Anyone who learns a foreign language would think that it is not true.\nThe only language that is easy to learn is the mother tongue. What is the mother tongue? It is the first and main language that you learnt when you were a child. And think how much practice that a child gets!\nBefore the Second World War, people usually learned a foreign language in order to read the literary(文学的)works of the country. Nowadays, speaking the foreign language is what most people want. Every year many millions of people start learning one. How do they do it?\nSome people try at home, with books and tapes; some use radio or television programs; others go to evening classes. If they use the language only two or three times a week, learning it will take a long time, like language learning at school. A few people try to learn a language fast by studying for six or more hours a day. It is clearly easier to learn the language in the country where it is spoken. However, most people cannot afford this, and many language learners need the language in order to do their work better. For example, scientists and doctors mainly need to be able to read books and reports in the foreign language. Machines and good books will help, but they cannot do the student's work for him. Whether the language is learned quickly or slowly, it is hard work with a lot of training in reading, listening, speaking, and writing.",

I really got a lot from mountain climbing. It gave me time to talk with my father and to be in deep thought as well as develop my patience (耐力)\nOnce we climbed a very high mountain. It was so challenging for me because I was only ten years old. During the first few hours of climbing, I enjoyed the flowers and trees, and the birds; singing; but as time passed, I got a pain in both of my legs. I wanted to_quit_climbing. In fact, I hated it at that moment, but my father said to me, \"_You can always see a beautiful sky at the top of the mountain, but you can't see it before you reach the top. Only there at the top, can you see all of the nice things, just like in life._\"\nAt that time, I was too young to understand his words. But later after that, I got new hope and confidence. I found myself standing at the top of the mountain. And there, I could see the whole of the sky was as clear as crystal (水晶).",

Some Chinese parents are usually glad to see their children study late. They will think their children work very hard. But not all parents are happy about this. Once a mother told us that every morning her 10-year-old boy put up one finger with his eyes still closed, begging for one more minute to sleep. Like thousands of students \" early birds \" in China, he has to get up before six every morning.\nA report shows that without a good night's sleep, students seem to be weaker than they should be. Many students have fallen asleep during class at one time or another. Too much homework is not the only reason why students stay up late. Some watch TV or play the computer games late into the night.\nExperts have said that students should develop good study habits. So some clever students never study late, they are able to work well in class.",

Many of the world's great cities are located on rivers, and almost every country has at least one river flowing through it that plays an the lives of its people.\nSince the beginning of history, people have used rivers for transportation. The longest one in the United States is the Mississippi. The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile. To the people of India , the Ganges is great, but it is also important for transportation; ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeast Asia, The greatest of all for navigation(航海), however, is the Amazon in Brail, It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles upon it.\nBesides transportation, rivers give food, water to drink, water for crops, and chances for fun and recreation for the people who live along their banks. In order to increase the supply of water for crops, engineers sometimes build a dam(大坝) across a river and let a lake form behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate(灌溉) their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries.\nHowever, large cities and industries that are located upon rivers often make problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluter with chemicals and other materials. People are learning the importance, however, of doing more to keep their rivers clean if they want to enjoy the benefits(利益) of this natural resource.",

Never let your attention be attracted by another course just because it seems to be more \"fashionable\".\nThirdly, listen to the English news program over the radio from time to time. Better go through the news stories in the Chinese-language newspaper first.

These dreams can be very big, such as winning the Nobel Prize; they can also be small, such as becoming one of the best students in your class.\nOnce you find a dream, what do you do with it? Do you ever try to make your dream real?\nAndrew Matthews, an Australian writer, tells us that making your dreams real is life's biggest challenge. You may think you're not very good at some school subjects, or that it's impossible for you to become a writer. Those kinds of ideas stop you from realizing your dream.\nIn fact, everyone can realize his dream. The first thing you must do is to remember what your dream is. Don't let it leave your heart. Keep telling yourself what you want every day and then your dream will come true faster. You should know that a big dream is, in fact, made up of many small dreams.\nYou must also never give up your dream. There will be difficulties on the road to your dreams. But the biggest difficulty comes from yourself. You need to decide what is the most important. Studying instead of watching TV will help you to get better exam results, while saving fiveyuaninstead of buying an ice cream means you can buy a new book.\nAs you get closer to your dream, it may change a little. This is good as you have the chance to learn something more useful and find new hobbies.",

In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. People there have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the northeast and the middle west, it is very hot sometimes and very cold sometimes. People in these states have more heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March.\nThe weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists showed that the IQ of a group of students was very high when a very strong wind came, but after the strong wind, their IQ was 10% lower. The wind can help people have more intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can make it lower. Students in many schools of the United States often do worse on exams in the hot months of the year (July and August).\nWeather also has a strong influence on people's feelings. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold these months. They might feel unhappy during cold weather. But big people may have a hard time in hot summer. At about 18℃, people become stronger.\nLow air pressure (气压) may make people forgetful. People leave more bags on buses and in shops on low-pressure days. There is \"good weather \" for work and health. People feel best at a temperature of about 18℃.\nAre you feeling sad, tired, forgetful, or unhappy today? It may be the weather's fault.",

But sometimes it's not convenient for the blind. There are not enough pavements(人行道) in our city. Some of the old ones are broken. They may not be safe to walk on! If I were the mayor of our city, I would build more pavements for the blind.\nWang Lili, 16,from Chongqing\nThere are more and more old people in our city. And there are not enough places for them to relax and enjoy themselves. So, if I were the mayor, I would build an activity center in each residential(住宅) area for the old.

And an attractively served meal will often improve a child's appetite. Never ask a child whether he likes or dislikes a food. Never discuss likes and dislikes in front of him or allow anybody else to do so .If the father says that he hates fat meat or the mother refuses some vegetables in the child's hearing, he may copy this action.\nParents should agree to the fact that he likes everything and he probably will. At meal times, it is a good idea to give a child a small part and let him come back for a second helping rather than give him as much as he may eat all at once .Do not talk too much to the child during meal times, but let him get on with his food; and do not allow him to leave the table at once after a meal, or he will soon learn to eat his food hurriedly so he can hurry back to the toys in his room. On no condition(任何情况下都不)must a child be coaxed(哄骗)or made to eat .",

She uses the name Linda on and has made a lot of friends who she contacts quite often.\nLast year Jean made a very special friend on , His name was David and he lived in San Francisco. David was full of stories and jokes. He and Jean had a common interest in rock music and modern dance. So it always took them hours to talk happily on and sometimes they even forgot the time. Of course, they wanted to know more about each other. David sent a picture of himself: he was a tall, good - looking young man with a big, happy smile. As time went by, they became good friends and often sent cards and small things to each other.\nWhen Jean's father told her that he was going on a business trip to San Francisco, she asked him to let her go with him, so that she could give David a surprise for his birthday. She would take him the latest DVD of their favourite rock singer. But when Jean knocked on David's door in San Francisco, she found that the special friend she had written to was a twelve - year - old boy named Jim.",

This makes what happened last Saturday even more disappointing.\nIt was my son's birthday so we booked a no - smoking * table at your restaurant for 7:30 pm. We arrived on time but were told our table was not yet ready. At 8:00 pm, we were given a table in the smoking part. I asked to move but I was told there were no other tables. A lot of people were smoking so it was uncomfortable unhealthy.\nOur first waiter, Toby, was very polite and helpful. He gave us free drinks for waiting so long. Our food also came quickly and looked nice. When my wife had eaten most of her meal * , she found a dead cockroach in her vegetables. She felt sick and wanted to leave. At first, the waiter told us it was a piece of onion. When we told him that onion does not have legs, he said sorry and took the food away. We asked for the bill, hoping not to pay for my wife's meal. Nobody came. After 15 minutes, I asked to see the manager. The head waiter told us that you were on holiday. I complained again about the terrible cockroach. He told me Toby had left without saying anything. He didn't believe my story and gave a bill for three meals. I argued with him but had to pay.\nThe waiter, Toby, was always friendly, but I would like your head waiter to say sorry to me and a full refund for three meals. It cost $ 68, Until then, I will not eat at your restaurant.\nYou can contact me at 742―3254 or through e - mail if you want more information.\nThank you,\nYours\nRaymond Yuer\nNotes: * Many restaurants in Western countries have smoking and no �C smoking parts. Some restaurants do not let people smoke.\n* In Western countries, people often eat from their own plates. They do not eat food from the same plate.",

Later they handed in their reports to the IOC (国际 奥委会). Nine cities hoped that they would have the honour (荣誉) .\nOn May 18, 2004, after careful checking of each report, the IOC chose five cities―Paris, London, Moscow, Madrid (马德里) and New York―to be the hopeful cities.\nSince'February, the IOC has visited these five cities to hear each city's report on how they will host the Olympic Games.\nWant to know the result? Some people guess that Paris will be the winner. London and New York could only show plans for gyms (场馆) which will be built for the Olympic Games. But Paris showed its excellent gym that was built for the 1998 Football World Cup.\nBut Paris could have a problem this time. The city ran against Beijing for the 2008 Olympic Games. At that time the IOC members thought that French people were too proud and so they did not win.\nBut don't rush to give an answer. Wait until July 6. On that day in Singapore (新加坡) the IOC will tell the world which city is going to be the next Olympic Games host. Before that, nobody can be sure.",

            "context": "PASSAGE FOUR\nIt is possible to do many simple tricks with numbers. Here is one trick. It has seven steps. First, write down your house number. For example, if your address is 73 Lemon Street, you would write down 73. Next, double it. In other words, multiply it by two. Then, add five to this doubled number. For example, if your address is 73 and you have doubled it, you will get 146. Then, if you added five, you'd get 151. So, to repeat the first three steps, write down your house number, double it, and add five. Fourth, multiply this number by 50. In our example here, if you multiply 151 by 50, you'll get 7550. The fifth step is to add your age to this total. For example, if you're 26 years old, you should add 26 to this total. In our example here, the result would be 7550 plus 26, you'll get 7576. Sixth, you have to add the number of days in a year, which is 365. In our example here, 365 added to 7576 is 7941. The seventh and final step is this: subtract(减) 615 from the number that you have. In our example, 7941 minus(减) 615 is 7326.\nThe result here, 7-3-2-6, is the trick. The first part of the number is the address and the last part of the number is the age of the person. That is, 73 is the address that we started with, and 26 is the age that we used.\nIf you follow these seven steps with any address and the age of any person. You will get the same result.",

I took my son out to the yard. \"I'm glad to see you.\" I asked one boy, \"Would you please tell me in which shop you bought the kite? My son likes it very much and I want to buy one for him.\" \"We made it ourselves.\" \"If he likes, he can take it,\" said the other boy. \"Thank you just the same, little boy. I'm going to make a kite for him. Thank you!\"",

He spent all his spare time in one of his four glass-houses and grew flowers of every color, with long and difficult names, for competitions (比赛). He tried to grow a rose of a new color to win the silver cup for the Rose of the Year.Mr. Flowers' glass-houses were very close to a middle school. Boys of around thirteen years of age were often tempted (引诱) to throw a stone or two at one of Mr. Flowers' glass-houses. So Mr. Flowers did his best to be in or close by his glass-houses at the beginning and end of the school day.But it was not always possible to be on watch at those times. Mr. Flowers had tried in many ways to protect his glass, but nothing that he had done had been useful. He had been to school to report to the headmaster; but this had not done any good. He had tried to drive away the boys that threw stones into his garden. But the boys could run faster than he could, and they laughed at him from far away. He had even picked up all the stones that he could find around his garden, so that the boys would have nothing to throw; but they soon found others.At last Mr. Flowers had a good idea. He put up a large notice made of good, strong wood, some meters away from the glass-house. On it he had written the words: DO NOT THROW STONES AT THIS NOTICE.

Sometimes he was sent away to a home for children who had no parents.But twenty years later, this same Chaplin became the greatest, best-known, and best-loved comedian (喜剧演员) in the world. Any regular visitor to the cinema, must have seen some of Chaplin's films. People everywhere have sat and laughed at them until the tears ran down their faces. Even people who don't understand English can enjoy his films, because they are mostly silent. It isn't what he says makes us laugh. His comedy doesn't depend upon (依靠) words or language. It depends upon little actions which mean the thing to people all over the world. Acting out without words, of common human situations plays an important part in the dances and plays in many countries. It's a kind of the world language.Chaplin lived most of his life in America and died in Switzerland on Christmas Day in 1977, at the age of eighty-eight.

Always try and drop the seller's offering price as much as possible before opening your mouth with a price.\nDO throw out really low prices like 10 RMB with a big smile.\nDO keep smiling from the beginning to the end. The seller usually continues bargaining with a happy smiling face. Getting angry hardly gets you the price you want.\nKEEP in mind the price offered by the seller at the beginning is usually at least 40% over the generally reasonable price. It can be up to 500% over.\nDO have an idea of what the item costs. You can ask your friends, people in the hotel or others you know, or look at the list below.

In fact, because you have two parents, your genes provide you a height that usually lands somewhere between the height of each parent. If both your parents are tall, then most probably you will be tall, too, but if you have questions about how tall you're going to be, ask your doctor if he or she can help you find it out.\nBut genes don't decide everything. For example, eating an unhealthy diet can keep you from growing to your full potential(潜力). Getting plenty of sleep and enough exercise will help you grow to the expected height.\nNo doubt(怀疑) you're wondering how fast you should grow. It depends. There's no perfect or right answer. Generally speaking, kids grow about 2 inches (6 centimeters) a year between age 3 and the time when they start puberty (when your body starts changing and becoming more grown up).\nYour doctor will know how your growth has been going over the years. Two centimeters here and 2 inches there are not nearly as important as the height you're at now, how you've been growing up to this point, and what other changes your body may be going through.\nDon't be scared if you seem to have grown a lot in a very short time. Everyone has a growth spurt(高峰)during puberty. The age for starting puberty is about 10 for girls and about 11 for boys. But it can be earlier or later ------between 7 and 13 for girls and 9 and 15 for boys.\nYou'll usually begin to notice that you're growing faster about a year or so after your body starts to show the first changes of puberty.",

Words are listed in alphabetical order �Ca, b, c and so on. For example, on a dictionary page the word \"poor\"-p, o, o ,r- comes before \"poverty\" �Cp, o, v, e, r, t, y-and the word \"poverty\" comes before the word \"power\"-p, o, w, e, r. The words are always given in alphabetical order.\nThe second thing, a dictionary will tell you how a word is pronounced. There are a few different pronunciations. Most dictionaries give phonetic, or sound alphabet. The phonetic spelling will tell different phonetic alphabets. Many dictionaries use the International Phonetic Alphabet to show pronunciation.\nThe third thing, a dictionary will tell you the meanings of words. You can look up a word and find out what it means. Many words have more than one meaning, and a good dictionary also tells you all of the word's meanings. For example, in English the word \"get\" has over 20 different meanings.",

There are more than 7 000 kinds of rice. Most kinds are water plants. Farm­ers grow rice in many countries, even in the south of the United States and in eastern Australia.\nChina is the world's largest rice-growing country. In 2003, China grew 166 million tons of rice. But it is not easy to feed the world's largest population. In the 1960s, thousands of Chinese died because they, didn't have enough food to eat. In the 1970s, Yuan Longping, a Chinese scientist, grew a new kind of rice called hybrid(杂交) rice. It makes 20% more rice than any other kind. Hybrid rice is a stronger plant, unlike ordinary rice. It can grow in lots of water or in not much water. It doesn't easily get diseases or worms.\nToday, half of China's rice plants are Yuan's special hybrid rice. China uses Yuan's hybrid rice to grow much more rice than before. Yuan is known as the Fa­ther of Hybrid Rice. He won the World Food Prize for his work to help feed so many people.",

A runner should start to prepare for a marathon at least three months before. Preparation may have races, many hours of running at different speeds and changes in diet. During the training time the runner must eat a fit diet. The diet should have lots of things needed in training the players.\nIn the early days of training, runners run 80km per week. The running is increased every two or three weeks and at least two long runs per week are needed. Two weeks before the marathon, the training programme becomes less, from 100km per week down to 60km and then to 30km in the final week. On the last two days they may not run at all.\nBreakfast should be eaten at least three hours before the race. Easily digested (消化) food such as cereal (谷类食物), toast(烤面包) and scrambled (碎的) eggs is best, with as much fluid (液体) as possible. Runners should drink water about half an hour before the race.",

The five rings of Olympics were drawn on the front of sportswear. It was the first time that the rings appeared on the stamps of the White Olympics.\nIn the 1950's, the stamps of this kind became more colorful. When the White Olympics came, the host countries as well as the non-host countries published stamps to mark those Games. China also published four stamps in February 1980, when the Chinese sportsmen began to take part in the White Olympics.\nJapan is the only Asian country that has ever held the White Olympics. Altogether 14 500 million stamps were sold to raise money for this sports meeting.\nDifferent kinds of sports were drawn on these small stamps. People can enjoy the beauty of the wonderful movements of some sportsmen.",

The biggest tax for most Americans is the incomes tax. The personal income tax is called a \"progressive tax\", because it takes more from those who earn most. For example, a person who earns about ＄3,500 a year, will pay a tax of only about 3.5% of earning, but if the same person earned ＄85,000 a year, he would pay an income tax of 35%. Over years the incomes tax has become more and more difficult for people to understand. Almost one half of all Americans now have to pay experts to prepare their tax reports.

This figure, however, depends upon the value at any time of his computer software company, Microsoft.\nGates established this company with Paul Allen in 1975 while he was still a student at Harvard University. At that time he believed it would not be long before every home had a computer, and that every family would need software. Software is the name given to the programs we use on a computer. The computer itself---the keyboard, monitor and processor---are called hardware.\nGates was born on October 28, 1955 and was already writing computer programs while still at school. In the 8th grade, he wrote a simple mathematical program and a computer version of his favourite board game, Rick, which is about world domination, and that he wants Microsoft to dominate the computer software industry.\nIn 1994 Gates married Melinda French, an employee at Microsoft. They have one child. Although Melinda no longer works at Microsoft, she spends a lot of time doing charity work and is a member of the board at Duke University from where she graduated with a degree in business.\nApart from Microsoft, Gates is interested in very fast cars and in the charitable organization he has established---the William H. Gates Foundation---in memory of his grandfather. He has already given more than US $ 200 million to this charity, which distributes money to organizations interested in education and the development of new technology.\nAs president of Microsoft, Gates spends most of his time in meetings with the different teams working on the company's many programs. He also sends out hundreds of e-mails a day. Anybody who wants to contact Bill Gates can do so on the Internet at",

Gou worked hard and tried to keep himself quiet, but he never forgot his pain. Many years later, he was set free. Gou secretly trained his army after he went back to his own state. In order to make himself strong-minded he slept on firewood and ate a gall bladder before having dinner and going to bed every night. After a few years, his country became strong once more. Then Gou took hold of a golden chance to fight against Wu and won the war in the end.\nIf one voluntarily(自愿) works very hard and voluntarily stands up to pains and difficulties in order to succeed, we might call him a \"Gou Jian\", and his story, a \"Gou Jian's story\".",

But have you ever heard of energy-saving(节能) policemen ?\nA group of 22 of these new policemen went to work last week in Beijing. They go around the city to see the use of energy in hotels, office buildings, shopping centers and onther public places. One of their aims is to make sure that these sites have set their air conditioning(空调) no cooler than 26 ℃.\nThey also set up a special phone line so that people can tell them which buildings fail to follow the rule.\n\"If everyone sets their air conditioning at 26 ℃, Beijing will save 400 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in one summer. That's one-third of all the usage of the city in the season,\" said a TV advertisement.\nOther Chinese cities, like Wuhan in Hubei Province and Yangzhou in Jiangsu Province, are going to follow Beijing's steps in setting up a similar police team.\nAs one of the fastest developing countries, China is using a lot of energy. This has a great effect on the country's environment and limited energy.\nFrom 1986 to 2005, the country experienced 20 warm winters continuously. Numbers show that Chinese cities have to spend billion of yuan solving(解决) environmental problems every year.\nAt the beginning of this month, China made its first action plan to fight pollution. It aims to reduce energy usage by 20％ and increase renewable energy up to 10％ from 7％ by 2010.\nTo introduce the public to a green life, last week Beijing held a show on energy-saving technology and productions. Environment-friendly machines, such as a vending machine that helps colllect used bottles, have attracted lots of attention.\n\"We want to tell people that there are certain ways to protect the environment.

It's because they're full of stock (库存) that hasn't sold in other stores: clothes that were last year's fashion; books that won't sell; inventions for the kitchen that didn't catch on (流行).

If so, here are some suggestions you need to know about audience manners.\nMost sporting arenas (赛场) have rules for audience which are written on the back of the tickets. Read your ticket carefully before you arrive. Try to reach your seat half an hour before the start of the event and don't walk about when a game is being held. When you leave, remember to take away your soft drink bottles and other rubbish.\nDuring exciting games, try to control yourself. Don't criticize (批评) the performance of players and coaches. Be careful with your words, since some may cause anger among other people in the audience.\nApplause is a special form of body language you can use to communicate(交流) with players. But you should do it properly. When players first appear, clap your hands together to welcome them; don't go on for too long. After an excellent performance, applaud (鼓掌) warmly.\nApplause is not welcome, however, while a game is being held and the players need to focus all their attention. Different sports have different rules for the audience. Enjoying artistic gymnastics (艺术体操) requires silence. But lots of cheering can really help basketball and football players. Using flash (闪光灯) to take photos is quite disturbing to tennis players. Mobile phones can not be used in shooting centers.\nTo be a good spectator (观众), you should take time to learn the game ------ related rules and audience manners of each event.",

Communities can be urban (in a city), suburban (near a city), or rural (in the countryside, far from a city).\nUrban communities usually have many neighborhoods, where people often live close together in apartment buildings or small houses. Streets in these neighborhoods often have lots of people and many stores and businesses. People in urban neighborhoods often walk or take public transportation to get to places.\nIn suburban communities, people live in separate houses. Stores and businesses are not usually nearby, and people often have to drive to get there. Some suburban communities have public transportation, and others don't.\nIn rural communities, people often live far from each other, not in neighborhoods. There isn't usually any public transportation, and people have to drive everywhere.\nWhether in urban, suburban, or rural areas, some communities are friendly, and others aren't. For example, in some communities, people know their neighbors, they help each other, and their children play together all the time. In other communities, people sometimes don't even know their neighbors' names.\nIn the old days, most people around the world lived in small towns and villages, where they knew their neighbors. These days, more people live in large urban communities. Experts think that in the future most people will live in \"megacities\" of more than ten million people.

One out of every six Americans works at putting together the parts of cars, driving trucks, building roads or filling cars with gas (汽油). Americans won' t live without cars!\nMost Americans find it hard to think what life would be without a car. However, some have realized the serious problem of air pollution by cars. The polluted air is poisonous ( 有毒 的) and dangerous to health.\nOne way to get rid of (排除)the polluted air is to build a new kind of car. That' s what several of the large car factories are trying to do. But to build a clean car is easier said than done. Progress in this field has been slow.\nAnother way is to take the place of the car engine (发动 机)by something else. Engineers are now working on some new cars. Many makers believe that it will take years to develop a practical model that pleases man.\nTo prevent the world from being polluted by cars, we'll have to make some changes in the way many of us live. Americans , for example, have to cut down on the number of their cars. They are encouraged to travel and go to work by bike. Riding a bike is thought to help keep the air clean.\nBut this change does not come easily ― a large number of workers may find themselves without jobs if a car factory closes down. And the problem of air pollution would become less important than that of unemployment ( 失业).\nAlthough cars have brought us a better life, they have also brought us new problems.",

Coffee is so popular, but do you know the story of coffee and how it was discovered? There is an old story that says coffee was discovered in Africa long, long ago.\nOne day, a farmer was watching his goats, and he saw them eat some small berries(干种子) from a plant. After they ate the berries, the goats became very active. The man often felt tired, so he decided to try the berries too. Surprisingly, he did not feel tired any more. Coffee plants were thus discovered. The coffee was taken from Africa to Arabia(阿拉伯岛), and there it was first used as medicine. The Arabs kept coffee a secret for many years. Later, coffee came to Turkey(土耳其), then Italy, then France. From Europe, the coffee plant was taken to America. People found that coffee plants grew well in many parts of South America, so large coffee farms were started , and many coffee plants were grown. On these farms, coffee beans were picked from the plants by hand. Then the beans were dried and prepared for market to sell. Different coffee beans were mixed (混合)together to produce different kinds of coffee. Coffee was sent to all over the world, and soon became very popular.",

Suppose a foreign boy asks an English girl to go out with him and she says, \"If I finish my work, I'll meet you in the cafe at 7 o'clock.\" Is she saying \"yes\" or \"no\" to his invitation?\nIn grammatical terms, she is using the conditional structure(表示条件的句式). By using the conditional, speakers of English can avoid giving a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to a question. It enables (使能够) people to be diplomatic(婉转的). If the girl doesn't want to go out with the boy, she won't appear(出现)at the cafe. She will let him understand she is still working. If she wants to go out with him, but doesn't want to appear too easy to catch, she has achieved (达到) that with her reply. Here she uses the first conditional which shows probability. It seems that she will go to the cafe. Being polite can make life very difficult!\nThe conditional is often used by people like politicians (政客), for example,who wish to avoid speaking out their ideas. This is very important if they are on their way to discuss an agreement. No one wants to give away his or her points before he or she starts. A government spokesman might say to a group of workers, \"If we could pay you more, we would.\" The use of the conditional here makes room for argument (争论) although the speaker is using the second conditional form, which shows improbability. So it is unlikely (不可能的) the workers will get their rise.\n\"If\" is a small word, which often appears in the English language. It can show politeness (礼貌), reported speech and conditionals such as the First--probability--if I can come to your party, I will; the Second--improbability--if I saw you tomorrow, I would give you the book; and the Third--impossibility (meaning it is too late to change something that has happened)--if you have told me, I would have helped you.",

She likes being anonymous*, talking to people who do not know about her famous family and her rich life. She uses the name Linda on  and has made a lot of friends who she contacts* quite often.\nLast year Jean made a very special friend on . His name was David and he lived in San Francisco. David was full of stories and jokes. He and Jean had a common interest in rock music and modern dance. So it always took them hours to talk happily on  and sometimes they even forgot the time. Of course, they wanted to know more about each other. David sent a picture of himself: he was a tall, good-looking young man with a big, happy smile. As time went by, they became good friends and often sent cards and call things to each other.\nWhen Jean's father told her that he was going on a business trip to San Francisco, she asked him to let her go with him, so that she could give David a surprise for his birthday. She would take him the latest DVD of their favourite rock singer. But when Jean knocked on David's door in San Francisco, she found that the special friend she had written to was a twelve-year-old boy named Jim.",

Never go with a stranger into a motor car.\n(2) Before crossing the road, stop and look both ways. First left, then right, look left again.\n(3) Keep away from the houses or buildings that are being built or knocked down. Something might fall on your head, or you might cut yourself on broken glass.\n(4) Medicines or pills(药丸) can be dangerous. Never swallow(吞下) any pills or medicines you find in the cupboard(食橱), even if your mother asks you to take the medicine without asking the doctor.\n(5) Wear a life jacket whenever(无论何时) you go out in a boat. Even if you are not in the open sea, and the water is not deep, you should have on your life jacket. It is easy to fall out of a boat.\n(6) Do not put your head out of a car, bus or train.

The American writer Sally Seamans tells young students some smart ways to find friends. Sally says finding friendship is just like planting a tree. You plant the seed(种子)and take care of it to make it grow. First, you should choose a friend. What makes a good friend? It is not because a person has money or good looks. A good friend should be kind and patient(耐心的). For example, if you have a bad day, a good friend should listen to your complaints and do his or her best to help. To make a friend, you cannot be too shy. You should make each other happy and share your lives. But things cannot always be happy. Even the best friends have fights. What should you do when you have a fight with your friend? You have to talk to him or her. When there is no one around, have an honest talk. If he or she doesn\"t want to talk, you could write a letter. There are three steps to being friends again: Tell him or her how you are feeling; say what your friend has done wrong, and explain why you did this or that. Remember that friendship is the most important thing in your life.",

A team of scientists from Ohio State University did experiments(试验)on 33 volunteers who were getting better from heart disease following operation. They found that people who exercised while listening to Italian musician Antonio Vivaldi\"s \"The Four Seasons\" did much better on language ability tests than without music. \"Facts suggest that exercise improve the learning ability of people with heart disease,\" said the psychologist Charles Emery, who led the study. \"And listening to music is thought to_enhance_understanding. We just wanted to put the two results together,\" he added. The volunteers said they felt better emotionally and physically after working out with or without the music. But their improvement on the test doubled after listening to music during exercise. Scientists have proved that music can be good for health, education and well-being. It helps reduce stress, sadness and nervousness; encourages relaxation or sleep; wakes up the body and improves memory and thoughts. In medical fields, music is used widely for patients who have had head hurts before and after operation. \"The Four Seasons\" was used because of its moderate tempo(舒缓的节拍)and positive results in earlier research.\" Exercise seems to cause positive changes in the nervous system(神经系统)and these changes may have a direct result on learning ability,\" Emery said. Scientists have been studying the results of music on understanding since the early 1950s. By 1990, psychologists were using Mozart\"s music, especially his violin pieces, to help children with speech disorders. Mozart was chosen because his music is not over-exciting and has clear structures. A study showed students who listened to Mozart went on to score higher marks in an intelligence test. With important exams drawing near, your parents will not probably allow you to listen to music. But perhaps now you have good reasons to argue with them.",

Chinese kids will be able to read it three months later.\nThe last one, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, came out on June 21, 2003.\n\"I only hope you feel it was worth the wait when you finally read it,\" said the writer J. K. Rowling, on the Internet. Rowling, 39, is going to have her third baby.\nThe latest book tells of Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry(霍格沃兹巫术和魔法学校).\nRowling has been thinking about how to start the new book for many years. She gave her readers some_hints_on what the book was about.\nRowling hasn't said who the Half-Blood Prince is. But she did say it is neither Harry nor Voldemort.\nOne of her characters(人物) will die in the book. No one knows who it will be. It's still a secret. However, fans can be sure Harry is safe for now. Rowling has said this may be the sixth and final book about Harry.",

Here's the story of these five heroes as Gary Lewis, the man they helped, tells it.\n\"I like to work on my old car. It's my hobby. I wanted to put a new transmission(传动装置) in the car. I put the car up on blocks(大块木头) because I wanted to get under it. I was trying to get the old transmission out when suddenly the car moved forward and fell off the blocks. It came down on my chest. I couldn't breathe.\"\n\"I tried to shout for help for about five minutes, but I almost could not breathe. Could anyone hear me? Was I going to die? Then all of a sudden I heard some little children from the neighbourhood. They were running to the car and saying, 'What happened , sir?'\"\n\"'Get help,please. I can't breathe,' I told them. One of the children ran to his house and told his mom to call 911. Then ,before I knew what was happening, all of the children were around the car. They used every muscle(肌肉) in their bodies to lift(抬起) the car, and I was able to get out from under it.\"\nLewis got out from under the car with just a few cuts. He didn't even have to go to the hospital. \"These children are my heroes,\" he says.\"Idon't know how they did it, but I am licky to be alive.\"\nRaymond Brown, father of two of the children, is very proud of them. \"We try to teach them to do the right thing. This shows we're doing it the right way, I guess, \"he says.",

Your eyes can tell you that a glass ball is round. But by holding it in your hands, you can feel how smooth (光滑) and cool the ball is. You can feel how heavy the glass is. When you feel all these about the ball, you really see it. With your skin, you can feel better. For example, your fingers can tell the difference between two coins in you pocket. You can feel a little drop of water on the back of your hand, too.\nAll children soon learn what \"Don't touch!\" means. They hear it often. Yet most of us keep on touching things as we grow up. In shops, we touch things as we might buy: food, clothes. To see something well, we have to touch it.\nThere are ways of learning to see well by feeling. One way is to close your eyes and try to feel everything that is touching your skin. Feel the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your body, the air on your skin. At first, it is not easy to feel these things. You are too used to them!\nMost museums are just for looking. But today some museums have some things to touch. Their signs say, \"Do touch!\" There you can feel everything on show. If we want to see it better, reach out and touch it. Then you will really see it!",

Washington State is thousands of miles away on the northwest coast.\nWashington D.C. lies between Virginia and Maryland on the Potomac River. It's about 220 miles south of New York City. The pleasantest and easiest way to get there is by long distance bus, or by the fast (125 miles an hour) train which costs a little more than the bus journey and a little less than flying. Washington is not a city that has grown up by chance as most big cities have done. It was carefully planned as the nation's capital by a French­man, Pierre L'Enant. The city was named after Washington, the much-loved, much-admired, much-respected first President of the United States.",

Suppose a foreign boy asks an English girl to go out with him and she says, \"If I finish my work, I'll meet you in the cafe at 7 o'clock.\" Is she saying \"yes\" or \"no\" to his invitation?\nIn grammatical terms, she is using the conditional structure(表示条件的句式). By using the conditional, speakers of English can avoid giving a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to a question. It enables (使能够) people to be diplomatic(婉转的). If the girl doesn't want to go out with the boy, she won't appear(出现)at the cafe. She will let him understand she is still working. If she wants to go out with him, but doesn't want to appear too easy to catch, she has achieved (达到) that with her reply. Here she uses the first conditional which shows probability. It seems that she will go to the cafe. Being polite can make life very difficult!\nThe conditional is often used by people like politicians (政客), for example,who wish to avoid speaking out their ideas. This is very important if they are on their way to discuss an agreement. No one wants to give away his or her points before he or she starts. A government spokesman might say to a group of workers, \"If we could pay you more, we would.\" The use of the conditional here makes room for argument (争论) although the speaker is using the second conditional form, which shows improbability. So it is unlikely (不可能的) the workers will get their rise.\n\"If\" is a small word, which often appears in the English language. It can show politeness (礼貌), reported speech and conditionals such as the First--probability--if I can come to your party, I will; the Second--improbability--if I saw you tomorrow, I would give you the book; and the Third--impossibility (meaning it is too late to change something that has happened)--if you have told me, I would have helped you.",

Please advise me what to do.\nAnswer:You are late for school probably because you go to bed too late. My advice to you is to go to bed earlier, buy a clock to wake you up on time.\nQ: I was brought up by my grandparents and began to live with my parents three years ago for a better study environment. They love me; I can see this in their eyes. But I don 't know how to show my love for them. What can I do to let them know I love them back?\nSara\nA: If you feel the need to show your love for your parents, that's great. Make sure you remember their birthdays and buy them cards and presents. Try to spend time with your parents. Tell them how you feel. Try to enjoy your life. Your parents want you to be happy―if you are happy, they will be happy, too.\nQ: I'm one of the best students in my class. But I always make some mistakes which I should not make. And now, I'm afraid to see my teachers. I just don 't know how to face them. Can you tell me how I can solve this problem?Molly\nA: The first-thing you need to do is relax. Worrying about your studies is not going to help. If you have any difficulty, tell your teachers. No teacher is going to get angry with a student who wants to improve himself.\nClever Monkey",

Finally, it talks about freedom,social rules and how people are punished(惩罚)for bad behaviour.\nWhy do I thinkThe Adventure of Tom Sawyeris a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876,but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today． And although it's only a story.  Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in the 19th century,so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature.

When you feel all these about the ball, you really see it. With your skin, you can feel better. For example, your fingers can tell the difference between two coins in your pocket. You can feel a little drop of water on the back of your hand, too.\nAll children soon learn what \"Don't touch!\" means. They hear it often. Yet most of us keep on touching things as we grow up. In shops, we touch things as we might buy: food, clothes. To see something well, we have to touch it.\nThere are ways of learning to see well by feeling. One way is to close your eyes and try to feel everything that is touching your skin. Feel the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your body, the air on your skin. At first, it is not easy to feel these things. You are too used to them!\nMost museums are just for looking. But today some museums have some things to touch.

It is in a color of dirty brown, and it is filled with strange plants.\nHow did this happen? First, we must think about how water gets into Lake Ponkapog. When it rains, water comes into the lake from all around. In the past, there were forests all around Lake Ponkapog, so the rainwater was clean.\nNow there are many homes around the lake. People often use chemicals in their gardens. They use other chemicals inside their houses for cleaning or killing insects. There are also many businesses. Businesses use chemicals in their machines or shops. Other chemicals fall onto the ground from cars or trucks. When it rains, the rainwater picks up all the chemicals from homes and businesses and then carries them into the lake. They pollute the water and kill the animals.\nBoats on the lake are also a problem. Lake Ponkapog is a popular place for motorboats. But oil and gas from boats often get into the lake. So more bad chemicals go into the water this way.\nPeople in Hartwell are worried. They love their lake and want to save it. Will it be possible?\nA clean lake must have clean rainwater going into it. Clean rainwater is possible only if people are more careful about chemicals at home and at work. They must also be more careful about gas and oil and other chemicals on the ground. And they mustn't use motorboats any more on the lake. All these may change people's lives. Only then can Lake Ponkapog be a beautiful, clean lake again.",

My favorite subjects are English and music because they are interesting. But I find science is very difficult for me. In fact I'm outgoing and friendly, and I have a lot of friends in Beijing. In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music and collecting stamps. I have hundreds of stamps from many countries. If I could join the project, I would learn more English and make more friends.\nYours,",

The other day I wrote an email to another classmate, Beth, in which I said some things about Rena that perhaps weren't very nice. Unluckily, when Beth was writing back to me, she accidentally forwarded(无意间转发) the message to Rena! Now Rena is really angry with me and won't talk to me, and Beth is unhappy as well. She's said sorry to me a hundred times already, but the harm is done. I feel bad, because I never would have said those things to Rena's face, but how do I get her to forgive(谅解) me? What should I do? Joe\nTo: From:\nSubject: Some advice Date: 22/06/2005 10:45 AM\nDear Joe,\nThis problem is more common than you might think! Email is very useful, but also very dangerous, as you don't know where your message might end up! First of all, you should say sorry right away to Rena. Explain that it was a mistake, and that you didn't mean to hurt her feelings. It may take time for her to be able to forgive you, but that's up to her. Then you might want to do something nice for her. Perhaps send her some flowers to show that you're truly sorry. Also, you should remember that old saying:\" If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.\" And good luck! Aggie",

If you really love it, just thinking about it can make your mouth water!When you love chocolate you may also eat a lot of it. But wait just a minute, isn't that bad for our health?There are different ways to look at chocolate and health. Some people think that chocolate gives people pimples (痘痘) and bad teeth, has very little nutrition (营养) and makes people fat. But some scientists say that eating chocolate makes people feel happy and excited. They say if we don't eat too much, chocolate is OK.Earlier this month, US researchers (研究人员) also said that dark chocolate is good for the heart. They say something in it can make the heart's arteries (动脉) get bigger and help blood move through your body better.That's not the only good news for chocolate lovers.Some scientists already say that eating chocolate doesn't give people pimples or make them worse. It is not always what you eat that gives you pimples.Chocolate only gives people bad teeth if they eat too much at once. The sugar in chocolate can be bad for the teeth, but the cocoa butter (可可油) can be good for them.Chocolate also has a lot of fat in it. The fat gives us too much cholesterol (胆固醇), and that can be bad for the heart. So it is best to just eat a little at a time.There are many different kinds of tasty chocolate treats, and most of us love to eat some of them. But which kind is the best for our health?Dark chocolate is better for the heart than milk chocolate. Also, dark chocolate has less fat. But with over 300 chemicals (化学物质) in chocolate, there is still a lot we don't know.So feel free to enjoy a chocolate bar, but take it easy. Save the other one for later!",

In 1888, when Bozo was only sixteen, his father left him on a little island off the coast of Croatia. He kissed Bozo goodbye and said, \"I hope everything goes well with you, my son. \"Then the father got back in his boat and sailed home without his son. How could he do such a thing, you ask? Well, Bozo had asked him to.\nBozo's father was a poor farmer who couldn't afford to feed his seven children. So he called his sons together and asked them to decide their own futures. Bozo chose the life of a_hermit_.\nDuring the years that Bozo lived alone, World Wars I and II were fought. But Bozo never heard about them. In 1972, a group of fishermen visited his island. They tried to talk to Bozo. At first the old hermit ran away. Finally, he let the men into his windowless stone house.\nThey asked if he wanted to go home. But Bozo said no. So the fishermen wished Bozo well and left him alone again-just as his father had eighty-four years before.",
