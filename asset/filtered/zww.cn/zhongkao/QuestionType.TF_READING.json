            "context": "Today's Women\nPeople like to say: \"The hand that rocks (摇动) the cradle (摇篮) rules the world.\" Or they say: \"Behind every successful man, there is a woman.\"\nNow some women still like making their husbands and sons successful. But some women want more for themselves. They went to be successful as men.\nToday the best jobs are still given to men. Even when women do the same work, they are often paid less than men. Some women want these things changed. They want to stand beside the men, with the same chances for success.\nNow many American women are earning money outside their homes. More than half of the women at the age of eighteen to sixty-five have good jobs. In general, working women have more education than those who stay at home.\nAmong women with jobs, eight out of ten drive a car to work, and most of them often spend their holidays away from home. They like traveling by air. Women's work has made several changes in women's lives and in men's lives, too.\nBut things are quite different from those in the Middle East countries.\nIn the Middle East countries, women have to stay at home. Their duty is to look after their families and do all the housework. They can't find work outside. When they go out in public, they cover their faces with something and walk behind their husbands.\nFor the past few years the women's life has been changing in those countries. Many women want to play an important role in the society (社会). Though working gives them few chances of getting married, many men still want to marry them in the old ways.",

I'm sure you will soon learn maths well if you do your best\"\n\"I'm afraid I can't, Aunt,\" said Sally. \"Girls can't be good at maths.\"\n\"I don't think so,\" said the woman. \"I was good at it when I was a girl. You must do more exercises and try different ways to practise doing maths problems until you work them out or at least understand them better. Here is a maths problem. Please think it over and see if you can work it out.\"\n\"OK,\" said the girl. \"Let me try.\"\nAbout an hour later Sally took the exercise book to her aunt and said, \"I've tried several times and worked out the problem at last!\"\n\"Well done!\" her aunt looked at her answer and said happily, \"Now you see, maths is not as difficult as you thought\"",

Each team must try to score more points than the other team. A point is scored when one man hits the ball and then runs around the playing field to each of the four bases(垒).The men who play baseball must do two things well. First, they must hit the ball when it is their turn. If they can hit the ball well, they can help their team to win the game. Second, they must catch and throw the ball well. When their team is on the field, they can keep the other team from winning. These are the two abilities (技能) that a baseball player must have.\nOf course, there are some good things about baseball. You don't have to be very intelligent(有才智的) to play baseball or to watch it. You can easily understand what is happening on the field. Many Americans enjoy going to a baseball game during the summer months. The weather is warm and it is usually pleasant to sit outside for a few hours and watch a game.

Isaac Newton continues to study at home. He enjoys physics and thinking about the mysteries of the world.\nOn a day when there is rain and sun at the same time he sees a beautiful rainbow in the sky. It has many different colours, he is told that there are five. Newton wants to have his own rainbow because he wants to look at it closely. He decides to do an experiment. On a sunny day he goes inside a small room and he makes the room very dark. Then he makes a small hole and the sun comes inside, it's a small ray of light. It's white. Newton takes a prism and holds it up to the light. The ray of light goes through the prism, but it isn't white now - there are many colours. The prism has split up(分解)the white light into different colours: Newton has a rainbow.\nNewton looks at his rainbow carefully. He can see more than five colours, he can see seven. He says the colours are: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.\nBut Newton is a scientist and he's always very interested in how things work. He has his rainbow but he wants to know more. So he takes another prism and holds it up to the rainbow. The rainbow goes through the second prism, but it isn't colourful now - it's white again. The prism has joined up the colours back into white light. Newton is the first person to understand that light is a combination of all the rainbow colours together.\nNewton also understands how we can see colour. Imagine a leaf in the sunshine. All the rainbow colours fall on the leaf but it absorbs all these colours. The only colour that is reflected(反射) is green, so the leaf looks green. Different objects reflect different colours. And perhaps Newton's favourite fruit is an orange - but what came first, the name of the fruit or the name of the colour?",

They cost eight times the price of the older bulbs. Many people don't like the CFL bulb. They find it too bright.

Hawaii became a state in 1959 and is smaller than 46 of the other states. The first Hawaiians arrived from other Pacific islands sometime about 100 A.D. Later more and more people moved here. Hawaii became an island with traditions* from several countries. People celebrate traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino holidays as well as the holidays from the United States. Hawaii has some special traditions. Hawaiians are very friendly and always welcome visitors. They give visitors leis. A lei is a long necklace made from beautiful fresh* flowers from the Hawaiian islands. Men wear bright flowered shirts, and women often wear long flowered dresses. Hawaii is known as the Aloha State. Aloha means both \"hello\" and \"good-bye\" in Hawaiian. It also means \"I love you.\" Hawaii has beautiful scenery. It is famous for beaches. People from different parts of the world like to relax themselves here. So Hawaiians make most of their money from the tourists. The families of the first people who came from the U.S. own most of the important banks and companies. Of course, many people from other countries are also buying and starting businesses in Hawaii. Sometimes when people from many different countries, races* and traditions live together, there are some problems. But in Hawaii, there are very few serious problems.

Because they are waiting to read a new book, \"Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince (<哈利・波特和半血王子>)\"!It is the sixth book in the Harry Potter stories. It will be in bookstores in Britain and the US on July 16. Chinese kids will be able to read it three months later.The last one, \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" came out on June 21, in 2003.\"I only hope you feel it was worth the wait when you finally read it,\" said the writer J. K Rowling, on the Internet. Rowling, 39, is going to have her third baby.The latest book tells of Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (霍格沃兹巫术和魔法学校).Rowling has been thinking about how to start the new book for many years. She gave her readers some hints (提示) on what the book was about.Rowling hasn't said who the Half-Blood Prince is. But she did say it is neither Harry nor Voldemort.One of her characters (角色) will die in the book. No one knows who it will be. It's still a secret. However, fans can be sure Harry is safe for now. Rowling has said this may be the sixth and final book about Harry as a young boy.On the Internet, Rowling said the book will probably be shorter than the 870 pages of the last one.
