When it is a gas, you cannot see it or feel it. When water changes to water vapour, we say that it evaporates(蒸发). When water vapour changes to water, we say that it condenses(凝结).\nWater can change from one form to another easily. This is why we always have fresh supply(供给) of water. Now let us find out how this is possible. The heat of the sun evaporates water, from the oceans(洋), seas, rivers and animals. Water vapour is formed. This rises and forms clouds in the air.\nWhen the clouds come near a mountain, they are forced(被迫) to rise. As the clouds rise, they are cooled. The higher they rise, the more they are cooled. This causes( 引起) more and more water vapour to condense. In this way, the tiny(微小) drops of water in the clouds get bigger and bigger until they are heavy enough to fall to the earth as rain.\nSome rain water which falls on the earth is again evaporated by the sun's heat. Some of it sinks into the ground. It may be used up by thirsty plants. It may reach a well(井) or a spring(泉). Most of the water goes back to the rivers, seas and oceans. This process(过程) then starts all over again. This process is called the water cycle.",
