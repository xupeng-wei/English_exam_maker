On Halloween, children wear special clothes and dress up like ghosts, monsters, or witches. Then they go to people’s houses in the evening and say, “Trick or treat!” If people give them sweets, they will go away happily. If they don’t, the children will play tricks on them. Many people put pumpkin lamps in front of their houses. The pumpkin lamps look very funny. I’ll give you a red sweater as a Halloween present. I hope you’ll like it.\nBest wishes!\nKitty",

For more than two months, the sun never goes down and there's no night.\nEskimos have warm clothes. They make their clothes from the skins of animals. From skins(皮毛) they make coats, caps and shoes.\nNear the North Pole trees can't grow, for it is too cold there. The Eskimos have to make their houses from skins, snow or stone.

Television has both sounds (声音) and pictures. It is much more real and interesting to watch television than to listen to the radio.\nHowever, fifty years later radio is still very popular and it will be here for a long time. One reason is that we don't need to see pictures when we listen to the music on the radio. In fact, listening with your eyes closed is the best way to listen to a piece of music. You can think yourself on a sandy beach or up high on a mountain. In other words, you can create (make) your own pictures.\nMoreover, while listening to the radio, you don't have to take your eyes off your work. For example, you can listen to the radio and drive at the same time. Or you can read a book and listen to the radio. Televlsion, on the other hand, doesn't have this advantage (优势).\nA radio is much smaller than a television. You can take a radio anywhere and turn it on anytime you want. In a quiet place you can use headphones to listen to the news or music on the radio. In this way (用这种方式) you won't disturb (打扰) anybody. Moreover, a radio is much cheaper than a television. For less than $ 20 you can buy a small radio and have fun with it.",

They drink it at any time of the day at homes or in the teahouses. They prefer plain tea, with nothing else in it.\nTea is also important in Japan. The Japanese have a special(特殊)way of serving tea called tea ceremony(茶道).It is very old and full of meaning. Everything must be done in a special way in the ceremony. There is even a special room for it in Japanese homes.\nAnother tea-drinking country is England. In England, the late afternoon is \"tea time\". Almost everyone has a cup of tea then. The English usually make tea in a teapot and drink it with milk and sugar. They also eat cakes, cookies and a few sandwiches at tea time. This is the so-called \"Afternoon Tea\" in Britain.\nIn the United States, people drink tea mostly for breakfast of after meals. Americans usually use tea bags to make their tea. Tea bags are faster and easier than making tea in teapots. In summer, many Americans drink cold tea―\"iced tea\". Sometimes they drink canned iced tea, just as soda.",

It is easy to tell from crows' sounds whether they are pleased or angry. Perhaps crows talk a lot because they are friendly birds.

There was too much traffic on the road, so we had to move very slowly. It took us about an hour to get out of the town. After some time, we came to a farm. It was clean and beautiful. The animals were very cute, we thought it was a nice place for a picnic, so we stopped and took the food, fruit and drinks out of the car. We sat down under a big green tree and began to eat. Suddenly a strong wind blew and soon it started to rain. We had to run back to our car and had our picnic in the car. Then we drove back home. What a bad trip it was!",

Television has both sounds (声音) and pictures. It is much more real and interesting to watch television than to listen to the radio.\nHowever, fifty years later radio is still very popular and it will be here for a long time. One reason is that we don't need to see pictures when we listen to the music on the radio. In fact, listening with your eyes closed is the best way to listen to a piece of music. You can think yourself on a sandy beach or up high on a mountain. In other words, you can create (make) your own pictures.\nMoreover, while listening to the radio, you don't have to take your eyes off your work. For example, you can listen to the radio and drive at the same time. Or you can read a book and listen to the radio. Television, on the other hand, doesn't have this advantage (优势).\nA radio is much smaller than a television. You can take a radio anywhere and turn it on anytime you want. In a quiet place you can use headphones to listen to the news or music on the radio. In this way (用这种方式) you won't disturb (打扰) anybody. Moreover, a radio is much cheaper than a television. For less than $ 20 you can buy a small radio and have fun with it.",

Then Bev heard other yawns.\nThe teacher said, \"Bev yawned because our doors and windows are closed. And the room is warm. Her body needed more air. Maybe she yawned because she was tired. Maybe she was hungry. Or she just needed to move a bit. Do you feel better now, Bev?\" he asked.\n\"Yes, \" said Bev.\n\"Yawns wake us up,\" the teacher said, \"When you yawn you stretch (伸展) many parts of your body. that stretching makes you feel good.\" There were more yawns. \"People do not know why they yawn,\" the teacher said. \"But if you see a yawn, hear one, or even read about one, you may yawn too. And once your yawn starts, you can't stop it. You may close your mouth to stop it. But the yawn will still come.\"\nThe teacher stood up and said, \"Let's open the window and let some air in. You may also go out for a drink. A cold drink or water on your face help to stop yawns. Bev may go first.\"\nHow do you feel now after you have read this story? Did you yawn?

            "context": "Dogs are friends of man. They work for us. They hunt with us. They also play with us. But a long time ago, all over the world, dogs were wild. Dogs can go back to the Stone Age. All dogs had the same ancestor (祖先). It is believed that this ancestor was much like a wolf. Other animals, like fox, also came from this ancestor. Thousands of years ago, man began to tame (使驯服) the wild dogs. When the dogs were tamed, they were trained (训练) well. The strong dogs then became working animals. They were trained to pull heavy loads (担子). They learned to keep watching over sheep and other animals. Working dogs could do other things, too. Some dogs were not strong. But they could help man hunt. Other dogs were best at pets. At first, there were only a few kinds of dogs. Today, there are more than 100 kinds.",

Wear comfortable shoes or boots, and take along an extra (额外的) pair of socks. That way you'll have dry socks to change into if you need them.\n2. Wear clothing in layers(多层) that you can put on and take off. As you walk, you'll probably get warmer. Then you can just take off a layer or two. Don't forget to carry a waterproof (防水的) jacket. The weather can change quickly here.\n3. Take some lightweight food along. Dried fruits, nuts, and crackers are good energy snacks. Be sure to carry plenty of drinking water. There are no water supplies(供应) along the trails.\n4. There are some poisonous(有毒的) snakes in the forest, but you won't meet them if you stick to the trails. Remember, the snakes won't bother you if you don't disturb them.5. Allow yourself enough time to get back to the campground(营地) before dark. So that you won't get lost, make some marks along the way you go.Happy hiking.",

Many years ago many great men rode on the hills about Fouls ham House, and many fine girls took tea in the Green Room.\nThe house has eight bedrooms, three bathrooms, two living-rooms, and a dining-room with a real Adam fireplace. Its library has a good view over the park and the river. All rooms are light and airy, with good, high windows, and wood floors.\nAt the back of the house there is room for four cars. The third Fouls ham once kept there. In many other ways, this house of the 1790s meets the needs of the 1990s. If you wish to know more about Fouls ham House, write to:\nHarvey. Platt, Long Ford & Son 6, Castle Green, Gilham, Byreside.",
