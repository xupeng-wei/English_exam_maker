      "context": "Imagine the year is 1666 and we can see a student called Isaac Newton. He's away from his university for a holiday and at home with his family. Isaac Newton continues to study at home. He enjoys physics and thinking about the mysteries of the world.\nOn a day when there is rain and sun at the same time he sees a beautiful rainbow in the sky. It has many different colours, he is told that there are five. Newton wants to have his own rainbow because he wants to look at it closely. He decides to do an experiment. On a sunny day he goes inside a small room and he makes the room very dark. Then he makes a small hole and the sun comes inside, it's a small ray of light. It's white. Newton takes a prism and holds it up to the light. The ray of light goes through the prism, but it isn't white now - there are many colours. The prism has split up the white light into different colours: Newton has a rainbow.\nNewton looks at his rainbow carefully. He can see more than five colours, he can see seven. He says the colours are: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.\nBut Newton is a scientist and he's always very interested in how things work. He has his rainbow but he wants to know more. So he takes another prism and holds it up to the rainbow. The rainbow goes through the second prism, but it isn't colourful now - it's white again. The prism has joined up the colours back into white light. Newton is the first person to understand that light is a combination of all the rainbow colours together.\nNewton also understands how we can see colour. Imagine a leaf in the sunshine. All the rainbow colours fall on the leaf but it absorbs all these colours. The only colour that is reflected is green, so the leaf looks green. Different objects reflect different colours. And perhaps Newton's favourite fruit is an orange - but what came first, the name of the fruit or the name of the colour?\n",

      "context": "In the year 1879, a boy named Albert Einstein was born in Germany. As a child, Albert was quiet and curious. He didn't speak very much until he was three years old, and some people thought something might be wrong. But Albert was always thinking. He loved puzzles and spent a lot of time alone, reading books and building things.\n\nOne day, his father gave him a small magnetic compass. Albert noticed that the needle always pointed in the same direction, no matter which way he turned it. He asked, “Why does it do that?” That simple question stayed with him for years. He wanted to understand the forces behind it.\n\nAs he grew older, Albert asked more and more questions. In school, he wasn’t always the best student, but he was deeply interested in math and science. He often asked questions that even his teachers couldn’t answer.\n\nLater in life, Einstein developed a theory called relativity. One of its ideas is that time and space are connected, and that time can actually move slower or faster depending on how fast something is moving. This was very different from what people believed at the time, but Einstein used logic, mathematics, and imagination to prove it.\n\nToday, Einstein is one of the most famous scientists in history. But it all started with a little boy, a simple compass, and a big question.\n",

Many Americans think that it is the national sport.\nBaseball is played between two teams of nine men each. Different men have different jobs when the team is on the field. Each team must try to score more points than the other team. A point is scored when one man hits the ball and then runs around the playing field to each of the four bases.\n\nThe men who play baseball must do two things well. First, they must hit the ball when it is their turn. If they can hit the ball well, they can help their team to win the game. Second, they must catch and throw the ball well. When their team is on the field, they can keep the other team from winning. These are the two abilities that a baseball player must have.\n\nOf course, there are some good things about baseball. You don't have to be very intelligent to play baseball or to watch it. You can easily understand what is happening on the field. Many Americans enjoy going to a baseball game during the summer months. The weather is warm and it is usually pleasant to sit outside for a few hours and watch a game. Baseball games don't usually cost much money. You can go to a baseball game for a very small amount of money, and still have a very good time.\n",
